      "Eli Sharabi, 52, was taken from Kibbutz Beeri with his brother, Yossi, whose death has since been confirmed. Eli's British-born wife, Lianne, and two daughters, Noiya and Yahel, were murdered in the attack.\n",

      "A judge has temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's plan to place 2,200 employees of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) on paid leave, hours before it was due to happen. Judge Carl Nichols said he would issue a \"very limited\" temporary restraining order in response to a lawsuit filed by unions, challenging the plan to place thousands of staff on leave from midnight on Friday. USAID, which is the US government's main overseas development arm, employs about 10,000 people, two-thirds of whom work overseas. It's unclear where the remaining staff stand regarding their jobs. Under Trump's plan, some 611 employees would have been kept working at the agency. The ruling came as officials removed and covered USAID signs at the organisation's headquarters in Washington DC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump has argued that USAID is not a valuable use of taxpayer money. It is one of many federal agencies his administration is targeting as it works to slash federal spending in the US. The Republican campaigned on overhauling the government and formed an advisory body named the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) - led by tech billionaire Elon Musk - to slash the budget. Friday's ruling by Judge Nichols came in response to an emergency petition by the American Foreign Service Association and American Federation of Government Employees - two unions representing employees of the agency.

      "USAID could slash staff to hundreds after placing most on leave Judge Nichols, who was nominated by Trump during his first term, said the written order would be issued later and go into more detail. The organisations who sued told the BBC they were waiting for the text of the court order to find out how all employees at USAID would be affected. But for now, it appeared that the more than 2,000 direct hires at the agency who are part of the unions would be safe, according to Lauren Bateman an attorney at Public Citizen, an advocacy group that filed the lawsuit. About 500 USAID staff have already been placed on leave by the Trump administration. During the hearing, the judge did not seem likely to grant other requests as part of the lawsuit, including to restore grants and contracts or reopen USAID buildings. The legal action argued that the president was violating the US Constitution and federal law by attempting to dismantle the agency. \"Not a single one of defendants' actions to dismantle USAID were taken pursuant to congressional authorization,\" it said. \"And pursuant to federal statute, Congress is the only entity that may lawfully dismantle the agency.\" Representing the Trump administration, justice department official Brett Shumate told the judge that the president \"has decided there is corruption and fraud at USAID\".\n",

Andrew and Dawn Searle, who moved to France from Scotland about 10 years ago, were discovered by their neighbour on Thursday. The mayor of Villefranche-de-Rouergue, Jean-Sébastien Orcibal, told French television that the deaths were \"clearly a homicide\". The couple lived in the hamlet of Les Pesquiès in a rural area north of Toulouse.\n",

The couple's bodies were found at about 12:20 on Thursday after a neighbour went to check on them at their detached house when they failed to turn up as planned for a dog walk. Mr Orcibal told BBC News the cause of the death was still unclear. He had earlier dismissed speculation the deaths were due to a burglary \"gone wrong\", and said \"no knife was found\". The area around the house has been sealed off and local police have called in expert help from the city of Toulouse.

      "The UK government has demanded to be able to access encrypted data stored by Apple users worldwide in its cloud service. Currently only the Apple account holder can access data stored in this way - the tech giant itself cannot view it. The demand has been served by the Home Office under the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA), which compels firms to provide information to law enforcement agencies. Apple declined to comment, but says on its website that it views privacy as a \"fundamental human right\". Under the law, the demand cannot be made public.\n",
      "\n",
      "The news was first reported by the Washington Post quoting sources familiar with the matter, and the BBC has spoken to similar contacts. The Home Office said: \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\" Privacy International called it an \"unprecedented attack\" on the private data of individuals. \"This is a fight the UK should not have picked,\" said the charity's legal director Caroline Wilson Palow. \"This overreach sets a hugely damaging precedent and will embolden abusive regimes the world over.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "'Back doors'\n",
      "\n",
      "The demand applies to all content stored using what Apple calls \"Advanced Data Protection\" (ADP). This uses something called end-to-end encryption, where only the account holder can access the data stored - even Apple itself cannot see it. It is an opt-in service, and not all users choose to activate it. This is because, while it makes your data more secure, it comes with a downside - it encrypts your data so heavily that it cannot be recovered if you lose access to your account. It is unknown how many people choose to use ADP. It's also important to note that the government notice does not mean the authorities are suddenly going to start combing through everybody's data. It is believed that the government would want to access this data if there were a risk to national security - in other words, it would be targeting an individual, rather than using it for mass surveillance. Authorities would still have to follow a legal process, have a good reason and request permission for a specific account in order to access data - just as they do now with unencrypted data. Apple has previously said it would pull encryption services like ADP from the UK market rather than comply with such government demands - telling Parliament it would \"never build a back door\" in its products. Cyber security experts agree that once such an entry point is in place, it is only a matter of time before bad actors also discover it. And withdrawing the product from the UK might not be enough to ensure compliance - the Investigatory Powers Act applies worldwide to any tech firm with a UK market, even if they are not based in Britain. Still, no Western government has yet been successful in attempts to force big tech firms like Apple to break their encryption. The US government has previously asked for this, but Apple has pointedly refused. In 2016, Apple resisted a court order to write software which would allow US officials to access the iPhone of a gunman - though this was resolved after the FBI were able to successfully access the device. That same year, the US dropped a similar case after it was able to gain access by discovering the person's passcode. Similar cases have followed, including in 2020, when Apple refused to unlock iPhones of a man who carried out a mass shooting at a US air base. The FBI later said it had been able to \"gain access\" to the phones.\n",

On Thursday, ITV News published an investigation which said it had spoken to \"dozens\" of people who accused him of \"unacceptable\", \"distressing\" and \"horrendous\" comments.

The Italian-born chef and broadcaster has also made appearances on BBC programmes. It is understood that there are now no repeats featuring D'Acampo in ITV's linear schedule. However, some of his programmes are still available on ITVX, the broadcaster's streaming service.

      "Rex Features It should take about two years to demolish the tower, the government said\n",
      "\n",
      "Grenfell Tower will be taken down, the government has confirmed nearly eight years after a fire that killed 72 people. The process is expected to take around two years and will be done \"sensitively\", with no changes to the building before the eighth anniversary of the disaster in June, the government said. The plan has drawn a mixed reaction from local people, bereaved families and survivors – some of whom want the west London tower to remain standing as a lasting reminder of the 2017 tragedy. Others argue its presence is distressing to those who lost loved ones and say it should be replaced by a memorial.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is clear from conversations it remains a sacred site,\" the government said in a statement. \"It is also clear that there is not a consensus about what should happen to it.\" Materials from the site and parts of the 24-storey tower will be made available for inclusion as part of a memorial \"if the community wishes\", the government added. The decision to dismantle the building comes after engineers advised the tower \"is significantly damaged\", the government said. Fire damage to the upper levels of the tower has been exacerbated by weather, according to a 2020 report. Experts have advised that the condition of the building will \"continue to worsen over time\" and it only remains stable due to additional protective measures put in place, the government said. Engineers have also said it is \"not practicable to retain many of the floors of the building in place\" as part of a permanent memorial, it added. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner concluded it \"would not be fair\" to keep some floors of the building while dismantling others, as doing so would be \"deeply upsetting\" for survivors, according to the government's statement. Community divided over fate of Grenfell Tower\n",

      "A specialist contractor will be confirmed in the coming months to develop a detailed plan for taking down the tower, the government said. The process of \"careful and sensitive progressive deconstruction\" will take place behind the tower's wrapping, it added. The area around the building has been closed off by temporary hoarding for more than seven years, and so it still has an impact on residents. When the deconstruction process begins, specialists will be brought in to work from the top down, dismantling the tower floor by floor. The government has rejected the idea suggested by some that the lower levels could be kept as part of the memorial being planned. This would be unfair to those with a connection to flats which are to be removed, the statement said. The emphasis will continue to be on respecting those who lost their lives, but also making sure there is no contamination of the area by dust or debris. Some survivors and bereaved families have said the tower should remain as it is until people have been prosecuted over the fire. No charges in relation to the tragedy will be announced until late 2026, the Metropolitan Police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) have said.\n",

      "Reuters Kimia Zabihyan said the meeting had been 'charged'\n",

      "Some former residents were told about the decision to take down the tower during a meeting with Rayner on Wednesday. A spokesperson for Grenfell United, which represents some bereaved families and survivors, said no-one at the meeting supported the plan, and that ignoring their wishes was \"disgraceful and unforgivable\". Kimia Zabihyan, from Grenfell Next of Kin, which also acts for some bereaved families, described the meeting as \"charged\" but said Rayner appeared to have attended with the \"best of intentions\". Downing Street said Rayner held the meeting to make sure bereaved families and survivors were the first to hear the government's decision. She offered bereaved family members and survivors the opportunity to meet in person and online \"at different times and places\", and had \"heard many views\" through the process, the prime minister's official spokesman said. But Emma O'Connor, who lived on the 20th floor of tower and escaped the fire, said survivors had not been properly consulted about the plan and called on Rayner to \"show us some respect\". Ms O'Connor has launched a petition calling for local residents, survivors and bereaved family members to be allowed to vote on the tower's future. In its Friday statement, the government said Rayner will ensure bereaved families, survivors and residents \"continue to have opportunities to speak to her\" on issues relating to the tower. It said Rayner was \"committed to keeping their voice at the heart of this process\". London mayor Sir Sadiq Khan said Friday's decision was a \"sombre moment\", and that he welcomed Rayner's commitment to a memorial and engaging with the Grenfell community.\n",

      "A top aide to Prince Andrew is urging a court to withhold his account of the prince's relationship with an alleged Chinese spy because he did not realise it could become public. Dominic Hampshire played a key role in the development of Yang Tengbo's relationship with the Duke of York - but the full details of what happened between the three men remain unclear. Last month a court rejected Mr Yang's appeal against being banned from the UK, after an intelligence assessment that he could be secretly working for the Chinese state. Mr Yang has denied all wrongdoing. Lawyers for the BBC and other media organisations argued at the Special Immigrations Appeal Commission (Siac) on Friday that Mr Hampshire could not keep his account private simply because he had lacked the \"common sense\" to find out if it might become public.\n",
      "\n",
      "In December, the court said Mr Yang had formed an \"unusual degree of trust\" with the prince and had not disclosed his links to an arm of the Chinese Communist Party clandestinely involved in political interference. It upheld the home secretary's conclusion that he was a threat to national security. Who is alleged Chinese spy linked to Prince Andrew? The BBC and other news organisations are now asking Siac to release a witness statement that Mr Hampshire wrote in support of Mr Yang after the aide had been first contacted by British intelligence. In submissions on Friday, lawyers for Mr Hampshire said that he had sought assurances from Mr Yang's lawyers that the witness statement would remain private - and he had only realised it could become public when he arrived at the appeal hearing last July. Mr Hampshire then withdrew the statement in an attempt to prevent it from becoming public. \"I was told that the information [in the statement] would be kept private and confidential,\" Mr Hampshire said to the court in written submissions on Friday. \"If there was any question of this being available in the public domain, I was not warned of it. \"If I had been, I would never have agreed to submit a witness statement, much less go into the level of confidential detail which I did. \"I wrote what I did in the statement with such candour – including about my own confidential commercial interests but also about the private interests of third parties – in the expectation it was for the private attention of one of the most senior ministries of state on a grave matter. \"I quite simply would not have volunteered to write about those matters had I known that there was any chance, however small, that it was for use in a forum which was or could become public.\"\n",

There's a lot to keep up with - so here's a reminder of 15 moves this week.\n",

      "1. Proposed the US 'take over' Gaza\n",

      "At a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Tuesday, Trump said the US would \"take over\" and \"own\" Gaza, resettling its Palestinian population in the process. Trump proposed developing the territory, devastated after 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas, into the \"Riviera of the Middle East\". \"The Gaza Strip would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting,\" Trump repeated on social media on Thursday, reiterating the idea would mean resettling Palestinians who currently live there.

The proposed cuts will affect the vast majority of the agency's workforce, leaving only a few hundred essential staff out of a total of about 10,000 employees globally. The move comes after workers were asked to stay out of the agency's Washington DC headquarters earlier this week. Cutbacks at the agency have upended the global aid system, with hundreds of programmes already frozen in countries around the world. The Trump administration reportedly intends to merge the agency, which distributes billions of dollars in aid globally, with the state department, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters he was now the acting head of the agency.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau agreed to reinforce the US-Canada border to clamp down on migration and the flow of the deadly drug fentanyl. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum agreed to bolster the country's northern border with troops, and in return the US would limit the flow of guns into Mexico.

However, a US judge temporarily halted the plan hours before the deadline, pausing it until a hearing on Monday to determine the merits of a lawsuit filed by federal employee unions, CBS News, the BBC's US partner, reported. Some of the federal government's more than two million civilian workers have voiced confusion about the terms of the deal, which the administration says would allow them to receive pay and benefits through September in exchange for resigning. Critics have questioned the legality of the offer and some federal employee unions have advised members to exercise caution around accepting the deal.

Ten detainees were sent, CBS reported, citing multiple US officials. The move came after Trump ordered that an existing migrant detention facility at the base be expanded to hold some 30,000 people. The Naval base has been used to house a small number migrants - a few dozen at a time, in recent years - for decades. Separately, nearly 800 people - most held on suspicions of terrorism - have been jailed at the base's detention centre since it opened in 2002.

Trump had claimed California withheld water supplies that could have made a difference in fighting the fires, which the state's Governor Gavin Newsom and other officials disputed, CBS reported. The water was released into a dry lakebed more than 100 miles (160km) away from the fires. Experts and officials told CBS the water could not flow to Los Angeles and would likely go to waste.

      "The Energy Secretary Ed Miliband is standing by the government's pledge to bring down household energy bills by \"up to £300 by 2030\". Energy bills went up in January and are expected to rise again in April and Miliband has faced repeated questions about whether that pre-election promise is deliverable. He has blamed fossil fuel prices for the rises and says the answer is clean, home-grown power: \"the cheapest forms of power are… solar, offshore wind and onshore wind\". The government wants to remove nearly all fossil fuels from UK electricity production by 2030. More power is coming from renewable sources than ever before, so why isn't this translating into cheaper household bills? There are a number of reasons, including the time and money it takes to make the power system greener, the question of who pays and the way the electricity market is set up.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do UK prices compare with other countries?\n",
      "\n",
      "The UK's electricity is expensive. Compared with countries in the European Union, UK domestic electricity prices ranked fourth highest in the first half of 2024 - the most recent government data. This is for consumers with medium usage, including taxes and subsidies. For industrial electricity, the UK had the highest prices - for medium users - over the same period.\n",
      "\n",
      "The UK has much higher electricity prices - both domestic and industrial - than other large economies outside Europe, such as the US and Canada. The largest, and most variable, component of a UK customer's electricity bill is the \"wholesale\" price. This is the cost at which suppliers buy it from the companies that generate it. Other parts of the bill include \"network\" costs for operating, maintaining and upgrading the power grid, and \"policy\" costs, which include government levies to help fund environmental projects. The main reason for the spikes in electricity bills over the past few years has been changes to wholesale costs. This is linked to an increase in international gas prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "How is the price set?\n",
      "\n",
      "The price for wholesale electricity is set by a bidding process, with each generating company saying what it would be willing to accept to produce a unit of electricity. Once built, the cost of generating power from renewables is very low, so these typically come in with the cheapest bid. Nuclear might come next. Gas generators often have the highest costs, because they have to buy gas to burn, as well as paying a \"carbon price\" - a charge for emissions. The wholesale cost is set by the last unit of electricity needed to meet demand from consumers. This means that even if gas only generates 1% of power at a given time, gas will still set the wholesale price. In Great Britain, this generally happens more often than its European counterparts, where demand can be met more often without relying on gas. \"The main reason why electricity prices are currently high is because the cost of gas - which is what sets the electricity price - is also high,\" said a spokesperson from the Climate Change Committee, the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "How cheap is renewable energy?\n",
      "\n",
      "Renewables can generate electricity cheaply. But building a wind farm on land - and particularly out at sea - comes with high up-front costs and the planning process is often lengthy. The government needs to triple wind and solar capacity and to get developers to build this, it needs to provide certainty that they will get a return on their investment. It does this by agreeing a fixed price - or strike price - that they will be paid for each unit of electricity they generate for 15 years into the future. If the wholesale price is below this fixed price, the renewable generator gets paid a top up by a government-owned company; if the wholesale price is above the strike price, the generator pays the difference back. Any costs or savings are then passed onto consumers via bills. Strike prices were expensive, but have fallen considerably, apart from a small rise from 2022-24 linked to global supply chain pressures. As more renewables are connected - and operational improvements mean the grid can be safely run on this type of power - there should be more times when gas is not setting the wholesale price. \"There are in practice very few hours at the moment in which gas does not set the price despite being a minority of the overall generation,\" said Adam Berman, director of policy at Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry. \"The more that you are able to have a renewable infrastructure that can deliver electricity at any hour of the day and in any circumstance, the more you are able to move away from gas setting the price.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What about extra costs?\n",
      "\n",
      "The UK has an ageing electricity grid, which needs upgrading, partly to accommodate new renewable power sources. There are times when wind power is actually paid not to generate, because the grid cannot handle all the electricity that it could produce. This adds to the network costs in a bill. Intermittent renewable sources also require backup for when it's not windy or sunny. In the short term, this role will be largely filled by gas, but eventually it could be met by storing renewable energy in batteries or by hydrogen power. Great Britain's island location means it is more expensive than in continental Europe to build interconnectors - cables to connect electricity systems of neighbouring countries - to help meet periods of low output. Some analysts have also argued that placing extra social and environmental taxes on electricity bills - rather than gas bills or general taxation - makes electricity artificially expensive.\n",

      "\n",
      "The tall, shiny buildings which rise out of the cornfields on the Myanmar side of the Moei river are a sight so jarring you find yourself blinking to be sure you haven't imagined it. Eight years ago there was nothing over there in Karen State. Just trees, a few roughly built cement buildings, and a long-running civil war which has left this area of Myanmar one of the poorest places on earth. But today, on this spot along the border with Thailand, a small city has emerged like a mirage. It is called Shwe Kokko, or Golden Raintree. It is accused of being a city built on scams, home to a lucrative yet deadly nexus of fraud, money-laundering and human trafficking. The man behind it, She Zhijiang, is languishing in a Bangkok jail, awaiting extradition to China. But Yatai, She Zhijiang's company which built the city, paints a very different vision of Shwe Kokko in its promotional videos – as a resort city, a safe holiday destination for Chinese tourists and haven for the super-rich. The story of Shwe Kokko is also one of the unbridled ambition which has rippled out of China in the last two decades. She Zhijiang dreamed of building this glittering city as his ticket out of the shadowy world of scams and gambling which he inhabited. But by aiming so high he has drawn the attention of Beijing, which is now keen to stamp out the fraud operations along the Thai-Myanmar border which are increasingly targeting Chinese people.\n",

      "Jonathan Head/BBC New high-rises on the Myanmar side are visible from Thailand's border\n",
      "\n",
      "Publicity about the scams is also hurting Thai tourism – Thailand is shutting down power to compounds over the border, toughening its banking rules and promising to block visas for those suspected of using Thailand as a transit route. Shwe Kokko has been left marooned in post-coup, war-wracked Myanmar, unable to bring in the flow of investment and visitors it needs to keep going. Yatai is trying to fix the city's sinister image by allowing journalists to see it, holding out hope that more favourable reporting might even get She Zhijiang out of jail. So they invited the BBC to Shwe Kokko.\n",

      "Getting there is tricky. Ever since construction began in 2017, Shwe Kokko has been a forbidden place, off-limits to casual visitors. As the civil war in Myanmar escalated after the 2021 military coup, access became even more difficult. It takes three days from the country's commercial hub Yangon – through multiple checkpoints, blocked roads and a real risk of getting caught in armed skirmishes. Crossing from Thailand takes just a few minutes, but requires careful planning to avoid Thai police and army patrols. She Zhijiang's colleagues took us on a tour, highlighting the newly paved streets, the luxury villas, the trees – \"Mr She believes in making a green city,\" they told us. Our guide was Wang Fugui, who said he was a former police officer from Guangxi in southern China. He ended up in prison in Thailand, on what he insists were trumped-up fraud charges. There he got to know She Zhijiang and became one of his most trusted lieutenants. At first glance, Shwe Kokko has the appearance of a provincial Chinese city. The signs on the buildings are written in Chinese characters, and there is a constant procession of Chinese-made construction vehicles going to and from building sites.\n",

      "Yatai is vague about the tenants of all its buildings, as it is about many things. \"Rich people, from many countries, they rent the villas,\" they told us. And what about the businesses? \"Many businesses. Hotels, casinos.\" However, most of the people we saw were local Karen, one of Myanmar's ethnic minorities, who come into Shwe Kokko every day to work. We saw very few of the overseas visitors who are supposed to be the customers of the hotels and casinos. Yatai says there are no more scams in Shwe Kokko. It has put up huge billboards all over town proclaiming, in Chinese, Burmese and English, that forced labour was not allowed, and that \"online businesses\" should leave. But we were quietly told by local people that the scam business was still running. Starting a decade ago in the unchecked frenzy of Chinese investment on the Cambodian coast, then moving to the lawless badlands of Myanmar's border with China, the scam operators have now settled along the Thai-Myanmar border. Around them, the Myanmar military and a hotch-potch of rebel armies and warlords are fighting for control of Karen State. The scams have grown into a multi-billion dollar business. They involve thousands of workers from China, South East Asia, Africa and the Indian subcontinent kept in walled-off compounds where they defraud people all over the world of their savings. Some work there willingly, but others are abducted and forced to work. Those who have escaped have told harrowing stories of torture and beatings. Some have come from Shwe Kokko.\n",

      "We were able to speak to a young woman who had been working in one of the scam centres a couple of weeks before our visit. She had not enjoyed it and been allowed to leave. Her job, she said, was as part of the modelling team, made up mostly of attractive young women, who contact potential victims and try to build an intimate online relationship with them. \"The target is the elderly,\" she said. \"You start a conversation like 'oh you look just like one of my friends'. Once you make friends you encourage them by sending pictures of yourself, sometimes wearing your night clothes.\" Then, she explains, the conversation moves to get-rich-quick schemes, such as crypto investments, with the women claiming that's how they made a lot of money. \"When they feel close to you, you pass them on to the chatting section,\" she says. \"The chatting people will continue messaging with the client, persuading them to buy shares in the crypto company.\" During our brief time in Shwe Kokko we were only allowed to see what Yatai wanted us to see. Even so, it was evident that the scams have not stopped, and are probably still the main business in the city. Our request to see inside any of the newly built office buildings was turned down. Those are private, they kept telling us. We were escorted at all times by security guards seconded from the militia group which controls this part of the border. We were allowed to film the construction work, and the outsides of the buildings, but not to enter them. Many of the windows had bars on the insides.\n",

She dismissed Yatai's claim that it no longer permitted scam centres in Shwe Kokko. \"That is a lie. There is no way they don't know about this.

Yatai wanted us to hear from the man himself, and hooked up a ropey video link. Only Mr Wang could be seen talking to him; we had to stay out of view of the prison guards, and had to rely on Mr Wang to put our questions to him. Not much is known about She Zhijiang, a small-town Chinese entrepreneur who Beijing alleges is a criminal mastermind. Born in a poor village in Hunan province in China in 1982, he left school at 14 and learned computer coding. He appears to have moved to the Philippines in his early 20s and into online gambling, which is illegal in China. This is where he started to make his money. In 2014 he was convicted by a Chinese court of running an illegal lottery, but he stayed overseas. He invested in gambling businesses in Cambodia, and managed to get Cambodian citizenship. He has used at least four different names.\n",

      "In 2016, he struck a deal with a Karen warlord, Saw Chit Thu, to build a new city together. She Zhijiang would provide the funds, the Chinese construction machinery and materials, while Saw Chit Thu and his 8,000 armed fighters would keep it safe. Glitzy videos by Yatai promised a $15bn (£12.1bn) investment and depicted a high-rise wonderland of hotels, casinos and cyberparks. Shwe Kokko was described as part of Xi Jinping's Belt-and-Road Initiative or BRI, bringing Chinese funds and infrastructure to the world. China publicly dissociated itself from She Zhijiang in 2020, and the Myanmar government launched an investigation into Yatai, which was building far beyond the 59 villas authorised by its investment permit and was operating casinos before these had been legalised in Myanmar. In August 2022, acting on a Chinese request to Interpol, She Zhijiang was arrested and imprisoned in Bangkok. He and his business partner Saw Chit Thu have also been sanctioned by the British government for their links to human trafficking. She Zhijiang claims to be a victim of double dealing by the Chinese state. He says he founded his company Yatai on the instruction of the Chinese Ministry of State Security, and insists that Shwe Kokko was then a part of the BRI. He accuses China's communist leadership of turning on him because he refused to give them control of his project. They wanted a colony on the Thai-Myanmar border, he says. China has denied any business relationship with She Zhijiang. While he denied any wrongdoing on Yatai's part, She Zhijiang, however, admitted to \"a high probability\" that scammers were coming to Shwe Kokko to spend their money. \"Because our Yatai City is completely open to anyone who can go in and out freely. Refusing customers, for a businessman like me, is really difficult. This is my weakness.\"\n",

      "It is, however, stretching credulity to believe that Yatai, which runs everything in Shwe Kokko, was unable to stop scammers coming in and out of the city. It is also hard to think of any business other than scams which would choose to operate here. With Thailand cutting off power and telecommunications, electricity comes from diesel generators, which are expensive to run. And communications go through Elon Musk's Starlink satellite system, which is also very costly. Yatai's strategy is \"to whitewash the project to create a narrative that Shwe Kokko is a safe city\", says Jason Tower, from the United States Institute for Peace, which has spent years researching the scam operation in Shwe Kokko. He says they may even \"begin moving some of the more notorious components of the scam industry, like torture, into other zones\". But he doesn't think the plan will work: \"What kinds of legitimate businesses will go into Shwe Kokko? It's simply not attractive. The economy will continue to be a scam economy.\"\n",

      "When we were eventually allowed to see inside one casino in Shwe Kokko, run by a genial Australian, he told us they were going to close it down. Inside the only customers were local Karen, gambling on a popular arcade-like game where they had to shoot digital fish. We were forbidden from doing any interviews. The back rooms, with the card and roulette tables, were empty. The Australian manager said the casino - built six years ago - had been popular and profitable when there were just one or two of them, before the civil war. But these days, with at least nine in operation, there were not enough customers to go around. The real money was in online gambling, which he said was the main business in Shwe Kokko.\n",

      "It is impossible to know how much money is made through online gambling, and how much through outright criminal activities like money laundering and scams. They are usually run from the same compounds and by the same teams. When we asked Yatai how much money they made they would not tell us – not even a ballpark figure. That is private, they said. The company is registered in Hong Kong, Myanmar and Thailand, but these are little more than shell companies, with very little income or revenue passing through them. We turned down Yatai's offer to see the go-kart track, water park and model farm that they have built. We did glimpse one other casino, while being taken to eat breakfast in Yatai's own luxury hotel, though we could not go inside it. It seemed empty. The only other facility we were allowed to see was a karaoke club, with spectacular private rooms, cavernous domes entirely covered in digital screens on which huge tropical fish and sharks swam. They also ran video loops extolling the vision and virtues of She Zhijiang. This club too seemed deserted, except for some young Chinese women who worked there. They wore opera masks to avoid being identified, and danced unenthusiastically to music for a few minutes before giving up and sitting down. Interviews were not permitted. We were allowed to talk to a local Karen member of staff, but she was so intimidated by this we got little more than her name.\n",

      "In his absence, She Zhijiang has left the running of Shwe Kokko to a young protégé, 31-year-old He Yingxiong. He lives with Wang Fugui in a sprawling villa they have built on the banks of the Moei River, overlooking Thailand, and guarded by massive Chinese bodyguards. There they play mahjong, eat the finest food and drink, and keep an eye on business. Mr He has a slightly different explanation from his boss for the scams still operating under their noses. \"We are just property developers,\" he said. \"I can guarantee that this kind of thing does not happen here. \"But even if it does, the local people have their own legal system, so it is their job to deal with it. Our job is just to provide good infrastructure, good buildings and supporting industries.\" But there is no legal system in this part of Myanmar, nor any government. It is ruled by the various armed groups which control different bits of territory along the Thai border. Their commanders decide who can build or run a business, taking their cut to help fund their wars against the Myanmar military, or against each other. Many of them are known to be hosting scam compounds. Mr He admitted that it was the war which had allowed Yatai to obtain the land so cheaply. Karen human rights groups have accused Saw Chit Thu of driving the original inhabitants off their land, with minimal compensation, though it is clear Yatai is also providing badly needed jobs for the locals. It is the lawlessness of Karen State which makes it so appealing to illegal businesses – and that doesn't help the image of Shwe Kokko.\n",

Chinese tourists have been cancelling their holidays in Thailand, fearing for their safety. Other rescues have followed. The BBC has been sent emails by some scam victims pleading for help; rescue organisations believe there are still thousands trapped. Nearly all are in smaller compounds along the border south of Shwe Kokko. Yatai stressed to us that they are not the same as these rougher operations, some little more than a collection of sheds built in forest clearings. That is where all the bad things happen now, they said. They talked about KK Park, a notorious compound south of the border town of Myawaddy, and Dongmei, a cluster of low-rise buildings run by a prominent Chinese crime lord called Wan Kuok Koi, better known as Broken Tooth.\n",

      "Former mining communities say they are missing out on millions of pounds of investment from the sale of social welfare sites for which miners helped to pay. A BBC Investigation found most of the £12.2m raised by selling 27 sites over the past 14 years had gone to the only national mining charity, but ex-miners and their families say the money has not been reinvested locally. The aim of the Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation (CISWO) is to improve the lives of former miners and their families in England, Scotland and Wales - but many of their services have been cut in recent years and local campaign groups say they don't see enough investment. CISWO says many of the buildings sold had been closed for years beforehand, and that it \"cannot ring-fence funds for specific use in only one area\". Among the sites to have been sold is Maltby Miners Welfare Institute, which sits in the midst of a housing estate in South Yorkshire. Once home to a popular bar, known fondly as the Stute, it is now a plot of wasteland. Terry Gormley remembers his first job collecting glasses in the bar in the 1980s, when it was the heart of the then-thriving mining town.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was a community asset which people have loved for decades,\" he said. Miners welfares date back more than 100 years to when social welfare pots - funded by payments out of miners' earnings - paved the way for the creation of facilities including pit head showers, recreational grounds and clubs. The money was \"raised by men on their hands and knees with a pick and shovel\", as one former miner put it. LISTEN: Ex-miners want millions from land sold \"against will\" Mr Gormley worked at Maltby Main Colliery throughout the 1980s, with thousands of others. The Stute remained an important place for them to spend time, even as the industry slid into decline in the following decades. It began to struggle financially and closed down in November 2018.\n",

      "Terry Gormley The bell for last orders rang for the final time at Maltby Miners Welfare - known as the Stute - in November 2018, before it was demolished to make way for housing\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Gormley set up a Facebook campaign group to save the building, which more than 2,000 people joined. The campaigners came up with a pitch to turn the Stute into a new social and skills hub, but CISWO \"just didn't believe in it\", Mr Gormley said. CISWO said it decided to sell the building after it fell into a \"dangerous\" state of disrepair that would have needed \"major rebuilding and investment\". It said no acceptable bids were put forward to keep the Stute. It was sold to the highest bidder, a local developer, for £246,000 in 2020 - a move that Mr Gormley feels was \"against the will of the people\" - with money from the sale going to CISWO. Six months after the building was sold, it was gutted by a fire and demolished. \"This place was financially viable and it was needed,\" Mr Gormley says. \"Now it's gone forever.\" Eight homes will be built on the site, according to a notice tied to the fence in front of the empty patch of land. Mr Gormley is among those unhappy that funds from former welfare sites are not reinvested locally.\n",
      "\n",
      "He believes CISWO has a moral duty to help. \"Not just here but all over the country, it's the same… the money doesn't come to the local people as it should.\" Then-Rother Valley MP Alexander Stafford tried to get a response from CISWO by raising the issue in the Commons. Mr Stafford said he believed money raised must \"benefit the people who live in the area that made the coalfields and the pits possible\". A group of Labour MPs is backing the calls that residual funds from welfare schemes should be retained locally. In a letter sent to CISWO in January and seen by the BBC it said \"we do not accept that this would not be feasible\". CISWO said it invests the money it gets from sales to generate income to be spent in former mining communities across the UK, and has spent £58.8m over the past 14 years. But CISWO says it cannot limit investments to one geographical area. It adds that it does not keep all of the money from a sale, as it has to pay costs such as debts owed by sites' trustees. It also said it had invested \"considerably\" to support a recreational ground in Maltby, leasing the ground to the town council for 25 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every week about 250 young players at Maltby Main Juniors use the pitches there. Some parents struggle to afford the £3 subs, but chairman Mick Mills says they raise \"just enough\" to get by. Mr Mills, who had been part of the 'Save the Stute' campaign, said: \"There's nowt [else] for kids. I want them to be able to go somewhere and enjoy it.\" The club hopes CISWO will use funds from selling the Stute towards the cost of a new clubhouse and pavilion. CISWO confirmed discussions about possible future investments were taking place. \"There could be a bit of light at the end of the tunnel,\" said Mr Mills. Based in Rotherham, CISWO was created under the Miners' Welfare Act 1952 to support miners, their families and coalfield areas. Following the privatisation of the coal industry in 1995, CISWO became a charitable trust, presiding over a network of 400 miners welfares, grounds, centres and convalescent homes. Some MPs at the time voiced concerns about the future of sites that had, as former miner and Labour MP Dennis Skinner said, \"come out of the ribs of the miners and off the shovel\". He sought assurances that \"none of the land would be sold off for development\", however no guarantee was given.\n",

      "In 2023, a group of cross-party MPs published a report on levelling up former coalfield communities, which criticised CISWO and recommended it should outline its strategic direction to clarify its aims and objective, to allow for better scrutiny. CISWO's chief executive, Nicola Didlock, said at the time she was \"profoundly disappointed\" by the findings and in January 2025 told the BBC the report was \"riddled with\" inaccuracies. A survey commissioned by the BBC last year, 40 years on from the 1984 miners' strike, suggested 73% of people living in former mining towns and villages felt they had seen little or no progress on levelling up. Former miner David Smith, from Dinnington, who was part of a local group which tried to stop the sale of a playing field, says he sees a \"pattern\" of CISWO \"taking money out\" of mining areas. CISWO sold Dinnington's \"hallowed\" old miners' clubhouse and land to housing developers, for £875,000, in 2020. It said the recreation ground had been empty since 2008. It said it had spent a \"considerable\", confidential, amount of funds on ongoing support for people in the area, and had also invested almost £100,000 towards a nearby 3G football pitch. However, it costs money to use the pitch and players must have bespoke astroturf trainers, making it \"financially inaccessible for Dinnington people\", Mr Smith says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Park House hosted a wealth of sporting activities for the Dinnington community before the land was sold to become a housing estate\n",
      "\n",
      "The BBC found more than 70% of the mining land sold in the past 14 years has been bought by major developers, with evidence of only one site - in Nottingham - being bought by a council for social housing. Across the country more than one million families and individuals are on social housing waiting lists, with many living in unsuitable accommodation. The government has pledged to build 1.5 million new homes in England over five years to ease the shortage. Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes? A recent report suggested that more than half of mining neighbourhoods in South Yorkshire are in the top 30% most deprived areas in England. Chris Kitchen, general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers, said old miners' welfare sites are being built on by major developers instead of being used for affordable housing. He said the new houses were \"out of reach and unaffordable\" to locals.\n",

      "'Like coming home'\n",
      "\n",
      "Miners' social welfare payments also funded convalescent homes for injured miners. These have evolved over the years and now offer affordable holidays to former miners and their families. CISWO funded thousands of places across the country - now only a handful of those sites remain. Lynwood House in Scarborough is run by the Yorkshire Miners Welfare Convalescent Trust. The trust is one of a number of mining charities to tell the BBC that when it approached CISWO for financial and administrative help, it received no support. Some have since closed, saying they feel \"let down\". Lynwood, which marks its 40th year in 2025, is facing £200,000 yearly running costs, and funds are depleting despite still having hundreds of clients. Joan Pickering lost her husband, who was a former miner, 10 years ago and says her trips to Lynwood still feel \"like coming home\".\n",

      "\n",
      "\"We would be lost if we hadn't got this place to come to, there was quite a few different places you could go to with miners and they've all gone,\" she added. Ian Gaskell, who works for the trust, is \"disappointed\" by what he says was a lack of willingness from CISWO to help. \"We've appealed to CISWO financially… in every case they've said no,\" the chairman said. CISWO said financial support for Lynwood \"would not be sustainable, given the deficits\", adding that any potential benefits for Lynwood guests would be \"clearly outweighed by other competing funding opportunities\".\n",

      "CISWO used to be funded by payments from the coal industry and grants from other organisations. But privatisation of the coal industry meant it had to become self-sufficient, and has been entirely reliant on income from its own investments since 2013. For the past six years, its average annual income from its £30m long-term investment funds was around £1.1m.\n",
      "\n",
      "CISWO has also received millions of pounds from the transfer of assets, such as property and land, following the dissolution of other mining charities. CISWO's personal welfare payments supported 2,439 people in 2023, compared to almost 10,000 in 2016 - a 75% decline, according to its annual public accounts. In the past eight years, it has also cut the number of its services and spend through its grants scheme, with around 70% fewer miners and families receiving charity grants. Education grants scheme provided by CISWO have also reduced by 30%. The charity said it had seen costs rise and fewer people seeking support. It said it had \"broadened\" support for mining communities, which \"changes and evolves as individuals age and needs grow\". It said it \"carries out enormous good works\" and had supported more than 130,000 miners or family members over the past 14 years, with more than £8m in grants. Back in Maltby, Terry Gormley still hopes the miners' legacy can live on through better support in the future. \"If you ask anyone in this community or any other community, they'll say they don't see any of the investment… and where it is really needed is in communities like this.\"\n",

      "On 26 January, thousands of displaced Lebanese, who had been living across the country, tried to return to their homes in southern Lebanon. They travelled in convoys, played revolutionary songs and waved, proudly, the yellow Hezbollah flag. Many found out that, aer more than a year of war, there were no homes to return to. They mourned what had been lost and, in the rubble of destroyed buildings, put up posters remembering the group's late leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The date marked the end of a deadline for the withdrawal of Israeli troops, part of a ceasefire brokered by the US and France, that required Hezbollah to remove its weapons and fighters from the south. The deal would also see the deployment of thousands of Lebanese soldiers in the area. But Israel said Lebanon had not fully implemented the deal and, as a result, not all invading forces pulled out. Lebanon also accused Israel of procrastination.\n",

      "Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "Unsurprisingly, there was violence. In some areas, Israeli soldiers opened fire and 24 people, including a Lebanese soldier, were killed. Still, for Hezbollah, which has been the dominant force in southern Lebanon for decades, the occasion was an opportunity to project strength, after being battered in the conflict with Israel. But can the group survive a wave of changes in Lebanon, and the re-shaping of power in the Middle East?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ability to paralyse\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the years, Hezbollah, the Shia Muslim militia, political and social movement, cemented its position as Lebanon's most powerful group. Backed by Iran, it built a military force more formidable than the Lebanese army. The use of violence was always an option. A strong parliamentary bloc meant that no major decision was possible without its consent while Lebanon's fractured political system gave it representation in the government. In short, Hezbollah had the ability to paralyse the state – and many times did so. The latest conflict started in October 2023, when Hezbollah opened a second front against Israel as Israel launched a war in Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks. The hostilities escalated dramatically last September, as Israel had penetrated the group in ways then unimaginable. First, pagers carried by its members exploded. Then their walkie-talkies. An unrelenting air campaign and subsequent invasion of the south killed more than 4,000 people including many civilians, left areas with a significant presence of Shia Muslims – which form the bulk of Hezbollah's support – in ruins, and severely damaged the group's arsenal. Many of its leaders were assassinated, most notably Nasrallah, who had been Hezbollah's face for more than three decades. His successor, former number two Naim Qassem, who is not as charismatic or influential, has admitted they suffered painful losses. The ceasefire deal that came into force in November was essentially a surrender by the group, which is considered a terrorist organisation by the US, the UK and others.\n",

      "Getty Images Hezbollah, the Shia Muslim militia and political movement, had become the most powerful force in Lebanon\n",
      "\n",
      "In this new reality, last month, Lebanon's parliament finally elected a new president – former army chief Joseph Aoun, who was favoured by the Americans – after more than two years of impasse that critics attributed to Hezbollah. Weakened, the group could not block the process as it had done in the past. In another sign of its diminished position, Aoun then named as prime minister Nawaf Salam, who was serving as president of the International Court of Justice, and someone not aligned with the group. Hezbollah, for now, seems to be focused on another priority: its base. The group has told its followers that the loss in the war is a victory, but many know the truth is different. Their communities are destroyed, and the damage to buildings is estimated to be over $3bn (£2.4bn), according to the World Bank.\n",

      "\n",
      "In a country with a collapsed economy, no one knows who will help – if anyone, as international assistance has been conditioned on the government taking measures that would curb Hezbollah's power. The group has paid compensation to some families, as it did after the 2006 war, but there are already indications of discontent. \"If people are still living in tents in six months' time, or on the rubble of their homes, they may start to blame Hezbollah rather than the government or Israel. This is why they're investing so much effort now to try to pre-empt that,\" says Nicholas Blanford, a Beirut-based non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council's Middle East programmes and the author of Warriors of God: Inside Hezbollah's Thirty-Year Struggle Against Israel. \"In the current context, you can push back a little bit against Hezbollah.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "An implicit threat\n",
      "\n",
      "But any action against Hezbollah comes with risks. On 26 January, hours after people tried to return to the south, young men on motorbikes drove through non-Shia areas of Beirut and other places at night, honking and carrying Hezbollah flags. Residents in some areas confronted them. In a country where sectarian divisions run deep and many still remember the days of the 1975-1990 civil war, the convoys were seen as an intimidation tactic. Mr Blanford said Hezbollah had \"the implicit threat of violence\" because of its military arm. \"If you push them too hard,\" he said, \"they will slap you back very hard\". A Western diplomatic official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss private talks, told me: \"We've been telling players here [the opposition] and in other countries: if you corner Hezbollah, it will probably backfire, and the risk of violence is a real possibility.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images Many Hezbollah leaders have been assassinated, including Nasrallah, who led the group for over three decades\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, a new chapter has been opened in Lebanon, a country exhausted by pervasive corruption, government mismanagement and seemingly endless violence. It is a combination that has resulted in a dysfunctional state. Addressing the Lebanese parliament in his inaugural speech, Aoun promised ambitious and long-delayed reforms with the knowledge that, without profound changes, Lebanon cannot be rescued. He vowed to rebuild public institutions, revive the economy, and, crucially, make the Lebanese army the sole carrier of weapons in the country. Aoun did not mention Hezbollah by name, but this is what he meant. The chamber enthusiastically applauded him; Hezbollah parliamentarians observed in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "A regional issue\n",
      "\n",
      "But the decision about Hezbollah's existence as a military power will probably be made far from Lebanon – in Iran. For decades, Tehran invested with weapons and money in a regional alliance it calls the Axis of Resistance, which constituted a ring of fire around Israel. Hezbollah was its main player. With thousands of well-trained, battle-hardened fighters and a vast arsenal that included long-range precision-guided missiles on Israel's doorstep, the group acted as a deterrent against an Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. This deterrence, for now, is gone – and rebuilding it, if that is Iran's wish, will not be easy. The fall of the Assad regime in Syria in December – in part because of Hezbollah's setbacks – has interrupted the land corridor Tehran used to arm and fund the group. Israel, which has gathered extensive intelligence about Hezbollah, says it will continue to carry out attacks on the group to prevent its attempts to rearm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images Last month, Lebanon's parliament elected former army chief Joseph Aoun as the country's new president\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Blanford told me that \"only Iran can really answer fundamental questions\" about Hezbollah. \"There is a possibility where either Iran or they [Hezbollah] decide to try to think differently, to disarm or become only a political party and social movement,\" he said. \"[But] this [ultimately] is Iran's decision, out of the hands of Hezbollah.\" I asked a source familiar with Hezbollah's internal affairs whether it was realistic to talk about the group's disarmament. The issue, the source said, could be part of a \"bigger, regional negotiation\", in what appeared to be a reference to indications by Iran that it is willing to reach an agreement with the West over its nuclear programme. \"And there's a difference between giving up weapons entirely or working under a framework with the state about their use, which is another possibility,\" the source added.\n",

      "Getty Images In his inaugural speech, Joseph Aoun (pictured left with Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam) pledged long-overdue reforms, warning that Lebanon's future depends on profound change\n",

      "Lebanon's new leaders are under pressure to act quickly. Foreign allies see the reshaped balance of power in the Middle East as a chance to weaken Iran's reach even further while the Lebanese are anxious for some stability and to have a sense that the rules apply to everyone. People here dislike when they are described as \"resilient\", given their ability to carry on amid the chaos. \"All we want is to live in a 'normal country',\" I heard from a frustrated resident in a mainly Christian area of Beirut last year. It is also the case that after so much suffering, even Hezbollah's supporters may be questioning what role the group should play. Hezbollah is unlikely to return to what it was before the war. Disarming may not be as unthinkable as it once was.\n",

      "UK house prices have hit another record high with the average property price reaching £299,138, Halifax has said. The UK's largest mortgage lender, part of Lloyds Banking Group, said property values recovered in January after seeing a slight dip in December. The annual growth in prices slowed to 3.0%, which is the weakest rate since July 2023, but Halifax said the market was showing \"noteworthy\" resilience. Amanda Bryden, head of mortgages at Halifax, said there was \"strong demand for new mortgages and growth in lending\", which might be being driven by first-time buyers trying to complete deals before an increase in stamp duty in April.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Budget in October last year, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said that reduced stamp duty rates in England and Northern Ireland would end in April this year. The changes will mean that house buyers will start paying stamp duty on properties over £125,000, instead of over £250,000 at the moment. First-time buyers currently pay no stamp duty on homes up to £425,000, but this will drop to £300,000 in April. \"Despite geopolitical uncertainties, and waning consumer confidence, other key indicators look fairly positive for the housing market,\" said Ms Bryden, with the Bank of England cutting interest rates and household earnings outpacing inflation. \"As things stand, mortgage rates are likely to hover between 4% and 5% in 2025, influenced by both global financial markets and domestic monetary policy,\" she added.\n",

Kendall was speaking to ITV about a Department of Work and Pensions survey that suggested 200,000 people on benefits were ready to work if they had support. The DWP report found 49% of health and disability benefits claimants felt they would never be able to work again. But it also showed nearly half (44%) of people with a mental health condition expected to be able to work in future if their health improved.\n",

I have no doubt, as there always have been, there are people who shouldn't be on those benefits who are taking the mickey and that is not good enough - we have to end that.\" The government says the number of young people aged 16 to 34 who do not work because of long-term sickness and have a mental health condition has reached 270,000. This number increased by 60,000 (26%) in the last year, according to the DWP. As of January, 9.3 million people aged 16 to 64 in the UK were economically inactive - a rise of 713,000 since the Covid pandemic. Last year, the government spent £65bn on sickness benefits - a 25% increase from the year before the pandemic.

The presenter and ex-footballer was dismissed from the BBC's Match of the Day and The One Show following complaints about workplace conduct. Jenas told talkSport's Shebahn Aherne on Friday that \"the biggest thing in this whole situation is about taking responsibility\" and he had been \"looking inwards, making some improvements\".

And once you kind of accept those things, then you can work on yourself and you can work on the other things and you can work on your family and work towards a brighter future.\" When asked about the impact his actions had had on his family, he said he realised \"they didn't deserve to be in that position\". Jenas added that he intended to \"get back on [the] path\" of being a role model. He will return to his job as a football pundit this weekend as co-commentator for Aston Villa vs Tottenham in the FA Cup for talkSport.

      "\n",
      "A former Conservative minister who lost his seat at last year's general election has been accused of continuing to \"parade around as an MP\" by the leader of the House of Commons. Brendan Clarke-Smith was a children's minister under Boris Johnson and the MP for Bassetlaw from 2019 until July last year, when Labour's Jo White won the seat. More than six months later, White has complained that Clarke-Smith's former constituency office is still displaying his title as MP, as well as the official portcullis logo of the House of Commons. Commons Leader Lucy Powell said she was \"appalled\" by the allegations - but Clarke-Smith dismissed them as \"daft\".\n",
      "\n",
      "He told the BBC he had handed back the keys to his office in November and the landlord would be replacing the sign when a new tenant is found. The issue was raised in the Commons by White, who asked: \"What action can be taken when the previous MP continues to promote themselves in the constituency where they lost their seat, retaining the Portcullis insignia and title in their publicity?\" Responding, Lucy Powell said she takes the matter \"very seriously indeed\" and would be checking on reports to the House authorities and the Standards Commissioner. She said: \"I'm really appalled to see some of the evidence she's sent about her predecessor effectively parading around her constituency as an MP - or shadow MP, or other such things that don't exist - and making use of the portcullis symbol, which is absolutely against the protocol for its use.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Posters displaying political attacks on the Labour government have been put up in the window since the election, when Clarke-Smith lost his job as MP\n",
      "\n",
      "White told the BBC: \"He's the only election loser in the country who is reminding people daily they didn't vote for him. \"My constituents are telling me they want it taken down - it's well over time for him to get over it and move on.\" The former MP's office has a bright blue sign running the length of the building that reads: \"Brendan Clarke-Smith MP, Member of Parliament for Bassetlaw\" and is flanked on either side by a large portcullis topped with a crown, which is the accepted emblem of Parliament. The window of his office door is displaying a more than a dozen political posters attacking White for the Labour government's winter fuel allowance cuts, which must have been put up inside the office since the election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brendan Clarke-Smith standing outside the Schoolwear Centre, which later became his office\n",
      "\n",
      "Clarke-Smith dismissed the complaint as \"a bit of a whinge... No-one is pretending to be an MP\". \"It's an empty office which has got a sign up still and I think the thing she doesn't like is its got a big picture of my face on it, which is very visible as you drive into town,\" he said. \"When someone moves in there and it becomes a cafe or whatever, they will rip that off - I don't think I'm authorised to. \"I think she just expects me to disappear and politics doesn't quite work like that.\" When asked about the posters attacking the Labour government in the window, he said: \"Somebody has probably left that in there.\" He said his office had formerly been a clothing shop that had been empty for about a decade, still with the original sign reading the Schoolwear Centre above the door when he moved in. \"Ironically, Jo White was the deputy leader of the council and responsible for regeneration for many years,\" he added. Clarke-Smith said MPs no longer had to clear out their offices and take down signs during elections because \"it was costing huge amounts of money\". Following every election there is a four-month period where former MPs move out of offices, make staff redundant and pay final bills, known as \"wash-up\" and Clarke-Smith said \"I think most MPs have only just closed their offices\". He also criticised White for using her time in the Commons to complain about him, saying there were many other more important local issues, including flooding and the new Accident and Emergency department. The pair also clashed during the last election, when Clarke-Smith reported White to the Standards Commissioner for an offer of visits to Parliament, although the complaint was not upheld. The House of Commons and Standards Commissioner were approached for comment.\n",

      "TikTok is being sued by the parents of four British teenagers who believe their children died after taking part in viral trends that circulated on the video-sharing platform in 2022. The lawsuit claims Isaac Kenevan, Archie Battersbee, Julian \"Jools\" Sweeney and Maia Walsh died while attempting the so-called \"blackout challenge\". The US-based Social Media Victims Law Center filed the wrongful death lawsuit against TikTok and its parent company ByteDance on behalf of the children's parents on Thursday. Searches for videos or hashtags related to the challenge on TikTok are blocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the firm, this block has been in place since 2020. TikTok says it prohibits dangerous content or challenges on the platform, and directs those who search for hashtags or videos to its Safety Centre. The complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware on behalf of Archie's mother Hollie Dance, Isaac's mum Lisa Kenevan, Jools' mother Ellen Roome and Maia's dad Liam Walsh. It claims the deaths were \"the foreseeable result of ByteDance's engineered addiction-by-design and programming decisions\", which were \"aimed at pushing children into maximizing their engagement with TikTok by any means necessary\". And it accuses ByteDance of having \"created harmful dependencies in each child\" through its design and \"flooded them with a seemingly endless stream of harms\". \"These were not harms the children searched for or wanted to see when their use of TikTok began,\" it claims.\n",

      "\n",
      "Ellen Roome, who believes her 14-year-old son Jools died after participating in an online challenge, has sought to obtain data from TikTok that could provide clarity around his death. She has been campaigning for \"Jools' Law\", which would allow parents to access the social media accounts of their children if they die. It was debated in parliament on 13 January 2025. \"Parents need to be aware of the dangers of social media,\" she told the BBC. \"I thought TikTok was silly dances and silly challenges like standing on your hands and putting your t-shirt on upside-down - Jools and I did several of those challenges - because we just thought they were fun. \"It isn't that - there's some harmful material there, and I think parents need to be aware and really, if they can, get their children to show them their phone.\" She said she believed it was \"morally wrong\" that TikTok will not give her access to her son's social media account. \"[TikTok] could have handed over the data and said, 'here bereaved parents, I hope you get some answers',\" she said. \"It's taking us going to court in the US to try to do that, and I think that's morally wrong.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Luke Walsh Maia Walsh's father said there were \"questions are in the air, and they need to be answered\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Leanda Barrington-Leach, executive director of campaign group 5Rights Foundation, claimed this was \"the horrific consequences of tech companies putting profit above children's lives\". The families' lawsuit comes as question marks hang over the future of TikTok in the US. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in January to extend the deadline for the app to be banned in the country unless sold to another firm. What does Trump's executive order mean for TikTok and who might buy it? A coroner concluded in January 2024 that Hollie Dance's son Archie died aged 12 after a \"prank or experiment\" went wrong at their home in Southend-on-Sea in April 2022 - and said there was no evidence he was doing an online challenge at the time, as his mother believed. Ms Dance, along with Lisa Kenevan, mother of 13-year-old Isaac, has tried to raise awareness about potentially dangerous social media trends in the wake of their childrens' deaths. Lisa Kenevan, speaking about Issac on BBC Breakfast in May, described him as a \"happy, normal boy\" who \"wanted to look after his mum and dad\". She said he was as an \"highly inquisitive, highly intelligent\" child who wanted to understand how things worked - leading him to attempt the blackout challenge.\n",

      "\n",
      "Police say the gunman in Orebro legally owned four rifles, three of which were found at the scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are certain types of weapons that are so dangerous that they should only be possessed for civilian purposes as an exception,\" the government said in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sweden's centre-right coalition, which relies on the support of the far-right Sweden Democrats party, said on Friday it would seek to increase vetting around gun purchases and ban certain types of weapon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Named widely in Swedish media as 35-year-old Rickard Andersson, the suspect had four legally owned rifles, three of which were found in the school, police said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seven women and four men between 28 and 68 died in the attack, police said, including the gunman, who killed himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sweden's government has announced plans to tighten gun laws in the wake of the worst mass shooting the country's history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, on a visit to Latvia, told reporters: \"We have to ensure that only the right people have guns in Sweden.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sweden Democrats said that it agreed with proposals to amend the law, including greater restrictions on access to semi-automatic weapons.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The horrific act of violence in Orebro raises several key questions about gun legislation,\" the party said in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The AR-15, a particular style of semi-automatic rifle that is both powerful and can carry large magazines, was singled out by the government as an example of weapons that could be restricted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Police have not said exactly which weapons were used in the attack, but the AR-15 has been used in many mass shootings in the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "They confirmed that several long rifles were found at the site of the attack in Orebro, along with 10 empty magazines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under current Swedish gun laws, anyone over 18 who does not have a criminal record can apply for a permit for a shotgun, handgun or semi-automatic rifle.\n",
      "\n",
      "They must justify to the police why they need a gun. People over 20 can apply for a special dispensation to own a fully automatic weapon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around 580,000 Swedes have a weapons licence out of a population of around 10.5 million, according to figures from Swedish broadcaster SVT.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 2017 Swiss study found there were about 2.3 million guns held by civilians in Sweden. That is around 23 guns per 100 people, compared with 29 in Norway and 120 per 100 in the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "To obtain a hunting licence in Sweden, a theory and practical test is required. About 280,000 Swedes have one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Police have yet to publicly identify the victims of the attack in Orebro, or declare a motive for the attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the dead, according to family and community members, were Syrians who fled the war there as refugees, as well as one Bosnian.\n",
      "\n",
      "Swedish police are usually cautious about naming suspects during an investigation, but the absence of official information has contributed to a feeling of fear and uncertainty among Orebro's immigrant communities over the past few days.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We need more information,\" said Nour Afram, 36, who was inside the Risbergska school when the attack began.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We don't know why he did it, why did he target this school? Was he sick or was it something else?\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Afram was waiting to go into class when she heard people screaming that there was a shooter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We started to run and then I heard the gunshots,\" she said. \"One at first, then tak tak tak - maybe ten shots. I was so scared I felt like my heart stopped in my chest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sweden has a relatively high level of gun ownership and gun crime, by European standards, though most weapons are legally owned and used for hunting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gun crime is mostly associated with gangs, who have also taken to using bombs to target one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Non-gang-related gun crime is less common, and Tuesday's attack the nation's first school shooting and its worst mass shooting. A total of four people were killed in two separate school stabbings in 2015 and 2022.\n",

      "\"We are not defeated in Fergie time, we are defeated in offside time,\" the former Manchester United striker told ITV after his side were beaten in round four.\n",

      "His frustration was that, with the scores level at 1-1 and the game in the third and final minute of injury-time and heading for 30 minutes of extra time, Maguire headed the winner, despite appearing to be offside when Bruno Fernandes sent a free-kick towards the back post.\n",

      "No-one has stated when a decision will be reached, although it was widely expected to be in the first quarter of 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guardiola confirmed this as he responded to a question about whether City's record £180m investment in the transfer market during the winter window was triggered by the possibility of City being hit by a transfer ban.\n",

      "Guardiola denied there was any more to it than merely strengthening a squad that has struggled badly compared to previous seasons. His side sit fifth in the league table, 15 points behind leaders Liverpool.\n",
      "\n",

He clearly wanted to hit the ground running - but, while he did well on a pre-season tour in the United States, he was outshone by Norwegian youngster Bobb.\n",

      "But his return to the international fold also frustrated Guardiola, with the coach annoyed England had again selected Grealish in November, despite his struggles with fitness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm always pleased for players to go - when they are fit and they haven't struggled for the past one, two, three or four weeks,\" said Guardiola at the time. \"In 17 days he didn't train once... Jack has had two or three setbacks in terms of injuries and could not get his rhythm.\" Grealish subsequently withdrew.\n",
      "\n",
      "If his confidence has been dented by Guardiola's pointed remarks, he would not be the first at City. Last year, Kalvin Phillips - another England international who struggled to convince his manager, despite costing the club £42m when signed from Leeds in 2022 - admitted he had been hurt by criticism over his weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guardiola later apologised, but it is clear his intensity and exacting standards can come at a cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to those who know him, Grealish is a popular figure within the dressing room, grateful for what his talent has given him, and a man who does not take himself too seriously. They claim he is also the player most likely to stop and talk to fans on site visits.\n",
      "\n",
      "As his sister Hollie has cerebral palsy, there was something deeply personal about the friendship he struck up with young City fan Finlay Fisher - who also has the condition - that led to him doing a goal celebration in the 2022 World Cup in his honour. It fits with Grealish's description of himself as \"relatable\" in a recent film posted on the City website. \"There's no filter,\" he added.\n",

      "In League One he made 37 appearances and scored five goals, with Derry witnessing the development of a young talent first hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I felt I saw two Jacks really,\" he told BBC Sport. \"One was this real young, immature kid who needed to quickly understand what we was looking to do at Notts County. Of course there was an immature Jack, he was 17.\n",
