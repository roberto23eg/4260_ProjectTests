0,GTA 6 Still On Track For Release In Fall 2025 But Exec Can't Rule Out Possible Delay,['Eddie Makuch'],"Rockstar's highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI remains on schedule to launch in Fall 2025, parent company Take-Two announced as part of its earnings briefing today. Some expected Rockstar to announce a delay given Rockstar's history of delaying its big games, but it did not happen.

In an interview with IGN, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said there is ""always a risk of slippage,"" but he feels ""really good"" about the game making it out on time in Fall 2025.

""Look, I think the game is eagerly anticipated both internally and externally,"" he said. ""We know that Rockstar seeks perfection. I never claim success before it occurs. I'm fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success, so we're all running scared and looking over our shoulders and we know that the competition is not asleep. Our whole organization is super excited.""

Separately, Zelnick told Variety, ""We've announced a pretty narrow window [for GTA 6]. So I think our view is that right now, that's fine. And then when itâ€™s appropriate, of course, Rockstar is going to have more to say.""

Take-Two's share price is surging following the announcement of earnings, growing by more than 7%. This may also be related to Take-Two beating earnings projections, suggesting positive financial health.

GTA VI has extremely big shoes to fill, as GTA V has now sold more than 210 million units, propelling the entire series to 440 million copies sold. One company believes GTA VI can sell 40 million units and drive $3 billion in revenue during its first year alone.

Rockstar's other juggernaut series, Red Dead Redemption, continues to soar as well. Red Dead Redemption II has now sold 70 million copies, up from 67 million just three months ago.

GTA VI is not the only big game that Take-Two has in the works for 2025, as the company is also launching Sid Meier's Civilization VII on February 11, PGA Tour 2K25 on February 28, and WWE 2K25 on March 14. Looking beyond that, Take-Two has Mafia: The Old Country lined up for Summer 2025, with GTA VI landing in Fall 2025, and Borderlands 4 at some point in calendar 2025.","Rockstar's highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI remains on schedule to launch in Fall 2025, parent company Take-Two announced as part of its earnings briefing today.

Microsoft has unveiled four new games for Xbox Game Pass this month, along with three titles getting added to the Standard tier of the subscription service. The most notable of the latter trio is Bethesda's Starfield becoming available on February 5.

The long-awaited Avowed from Obsidian will arrive February 18 as a day-one release for Game Pass. Recently, the developer explained how the RPG not being totally open-world is a good thing. That said, Avowed is still full of discoveries and the freedom to find them in the game's open zones.

Meanwhile, with the Super Bowl happening this weekend, Madden NFL 25 is running on to the service on February 6. That means you could play or simulate Sunday's matchup between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs in the game.

The other two new entries for Game Pass are Far Cry: New Dawn--which is available right now--and Kingdom Two Crowns on February 13. The former just received an update on Xbox Series X|S that offers native 60fps for the shooter, per the official Far Cry account on X.

As for current Game Pass offerings coming to the Standard tier, Starfield is joined by Another Crab's Treasure and Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes. All three hit the middle tier on February 5. Microsoft is also removing seven titles from Game Pass in the middle of the month, including Tales of Arise.","Microsoft has unveiled four new games for Xbox Game Pass this month, along with three titles getting added to the Standard tier of the subscription service.

2,Games Leaving Game Pass Soon Include A Big JRPG,['George Yang'],"GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.

With new games being added to Xbox Game Pass, it's inevitable that others will leave. The big addition for this month is Avowed, which launches on February 18. But this month also sees the loss of some good games, including a big JRPG, on February 15.

Tales of Arise is the latest entry in the Tales series and the only entry that received a DLC expansion titled Beyond the Dawn. Last month, it was revealed that Tales of Arise was leaving PlayStation Plus, so it's not a surprise that it's leaving Game Pass as well.

Koji Igarashi's excellent side-scrolling game Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is leaving too. It's a spiritual successor to the Castlevania series, and a sequel was announced in 2021, so be sure to check it out while you can.

Lab Zero Games' Indivisible is a turn-based game inspired by Valkyrie Profile and Southeast Asian mythology. It's an interesting blend of influences and it's unfortunate that the studio shut down back in 2020.

3,PlayStation Plus Free Games For February 2025 Live Now,['Darryn Bonthuys'],"PlayStation has released this month's batch of free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers. All PS Plus members can now claim a trio of freebies--Payday 3, High on Life, and Pac-Man World: Re-Pac.

Sony also mentioned that it will focus more on offering PS5 titles through the monthly games and Game Catalog benefit starting January 2026. While PS4 owners may still receive free games as part of the subscription, Sony says these will only be occasionally handed out from next year.

Payday 3

It hasn't exactly been smooth sailing for Payday 3, which was supposed to kick off the next era of the popular bank-heist-simulator series. While the core game isn't bad, numerous server issues and low player numbers made for a rough launch, but developer Starbreeze hasn't thrown in the towel on Payday 3. yet. As part of an effort titled Operation Medic Bag, Starbreeze has been steadily improving on the game with several patches and an offline mode.

High on Life

If you're a fan of Rick and Morty, then High on Life will appeal to you as it shares much of the same oddball humor as the hit animated series. A first-person shooter that features very talkative guns and an alien space cartel who get ""high"" on humans, the game was made by Squanch Games, a studio founded by Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland and Tanya Watson. Roiland resigned from the company in 2023, following a series of controversies.

Pac-Man World: Re-Pac

A remake of the original Pac-Man World platformer, Pac-Man World: Re-Pac is a charming game featuring the Bandai Namco icon. Its gameplay was overhauled and its graphics were updated for this 2022 release, which saw Pac-Man embark on a quest to save his friends and family from the ghosts who had kidnapped them.

You're then introduced to the commander, Ditrich Katz. Katz wants you to find a lost charter that's supposed to be delivered by his soldiers, one of whom is actually being tended to by a foreign physician.

So, who exactly is this Musa that you need to save in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2? Well, he's none other than an accomplished healer and scholar who's been everywhere in the known world, from the Iberia to the Holy Land and every place in between. Due to circumstances, Musa now serves King Sigismund. Meanwhile, the soldier that he's treating, Myshek, seems to be worse for wear.

This is an optional task, but you can diagnose Myshek to learn about his condition. You then need to give him 1x Strong Cockerel. You can't find any of these bottles nearby, so you have to brew one on your own. We discuss the basic steps in our Alchemy guide, but here's the gist:

Grind 2x Mint using the mortar and pestle, then put it in the cauldron.

Boil for one turn.

Add 1x Valerian.

Boil for two turns.

Hold the phial and interact with the still.

Note: Completing the brewing process perfectly while using dried herbs isn't enough. You need to use fresh Mint and Valerian herbs if you want a better chance at getting Strong Cockerel.","So, who exactly is this Musa that you need to save in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2?

Around this time every year, WWE fans can expect three things: the Royal Rumble event being a glorious free-for-all, WWE superstars constantly pointing at the Wrestlemania sign, and the reveal of a new WWE 2K game. So far, it looks like this year's entry in the long-running series will be the biggest to date, as developer Visual Concepts is teasing a gigantic roster of WWE legends, superstars, and rookie sensations in the game.

Last year's game featured several hundred wrestlers from across the RAW, Smackdown, and NXT rosters, and the vast majority of them will be returning for WWE 2K25. The main event draw this year is a Showcase mode focused on The Bloodline, one of the most dominant WWE groups of all time. The mode will cover multiple eras of the Anoa'i dynasty that shaped WWE programming over several decades and will feature wrestlers like Roman Reigns, The Rock, Yokozuna, Jacob Fatu, and more in the spotlight. Even better, Showcase mode this year is hosted by The Bloodline's resident wiseman, Paul Heyman.

Other things to look forward to in WWE 2K25 include a brand-new open-world social space for your custom MySuperstar creation to explore, new match types like Bloodline rules and intergender showdowns, and an overhaul of the fantasy-card-collecting MyFaction mode.

While Visual Concepts says you can expect 300+ wrestlers in WWE 2K25--and has name-dropped quite a few already--for now we'll be keeping this list focused on the superstars who are officially confirmed to be in the game so far. You can check back regularly, because like last year, this feature will be constantly updated ahead of the game's release on March 14 for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.

How to romance Rosa in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - Romance guide

The Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Rosa romance primarily hinges on how you treat her at certain parts of the campaign. You first meet her during a main quest called Via Argentum, where she shows you that she's more than just a lady who could be pushed around by men. She's free-spirited and independent, with an intellect that leaves poor Henry at a loss for words sometimes.

Then, during Taking French Leave, she asks you to find a book in a fortress. Finally, during Oratores, you have a chance to seal the deal with a kiss.","GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.

With the rise in popularity and prominence of free-to-play games like Fortnite, CS: GO, PUBG, and others, games are reaching astounding player counts and tallying huge amounts of play time. But in terms of sales numbers for paid games, what are the best-selling games of all time? Here in this gallery we are running through the top 10 best-selling games of all time based on the latest publicly available data.

This list does not include free-to-play games, which is why you won't see juggernauts like Fortnite, Rocket League, Dota 2, and CS: GO on the list, among others. Those games have no doubt reached many, many more people and are probably best compared against other free-to-play games.

The list does, however, include sales of pack-in games for hardware bundlesâ€“and that is an important distinction. For example, Wii Sports sold about 83 million copies thanks in part to it being bundled with the Wii. The original Super Mario Bros. was a pack-in game as well for the NES.

With these caveats out of the way, let's dive into the Top 10 best-selling games ever. We're betting you can probably guess a few of these!

We will continue to update this list over time as GTA 5 inevitably continues to sell more and more copies.","With the rise in popularity and prominence of free-to-play games like Fortnite, CS: GO, PUBG, and others, games are reaching astounding player counts and tallying huge amounts of play time.

This year, there several games that could earn high review scores, like Monster Hunter Wilds, Split Fiction, and Assassin's Creed Shadows, to name a few.

The 2024 gaming year is nearing the finish line, and if there's a common thread linking all of this year's biggest releases, it's that several of these games have been surprise hits. While 2023 was loaded with modern masterpieces like Baldur's Gate 3, Street Fighter 6, and Alan Wake 2, 2024 has delivered hits like Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, Dragon's Dogma 2, and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

While those games were almost predestined to to launch with high review scores behind them, it's the unexpected games released this year that have overshadowed them. We've had some terrific hits that have seemingly come from out of nowhere, like the gung-ho action of Helldivers 2, the oddball British humor of Thank Goodness You're Here, and not one but two Prince of Persia games taking the series in bold new directions.

Throw in must-play indie games, solid outings from some of the biggest brands, and a few hidden gems, and 2024 has been a year where gaming's best and weirdest releases have risen to the top.

Valentineâ€™s Day is just around the corner, and if youâ€™re looking for a fun gift to give your loved one, Lego sets are always a great option. Not only do you get a gorgeous display piece when the project is complete, but building together is a great way to spend the evening. If you're looking for a set to share, you're in luck--Lego just launched a slew of new sets in January, and older kits are seeing huge price cuts for the holiday.

For something with a Valentineâ€™s Day theme, consider picking up the Lego Heart Ornament. Itâ€™s affordable at just $13, and with only 254 pieces, you should be able to piece it together in a single building session. For something larger, check out the $60 Lego Botanicals Pretty Pink Flower Bouquet. This new 749-piece display lets you build 15 different flowers.

Beyond flowers, a few cool Lego sets based on video games are up for grabs. Itâ€™s not cheap, but the Lego The Legend of Zelda Great Deku Tree is a massive build thatâ€™ll keep you and your partner busy for several days. At 2,500 pieces and the option to create two different scenes, itâ€™s a great gift for any Zelda fan. Mario fans can instead pick up the Lego Super Mario Piranha Plant thatâ€™s on sale for $48 (was $60).

Note that these cover both new releases from January 1 and sets on sale ahead of February 14. Also, be sure to check the shipping dates on these sets.

Like the seemingly unending comic book movie craze, Hollywood loves to find a type of film that it can turn into the next big cultural touchstone. Over the years, we've seen movies based on video games attempt to reach that level, with varying levels of success. We've seen adaptations of games for decades, but, to be fair, a lot of these were awful adaptations. Many of them missed the point of the source material and were clumsily executed--although we'll always have a soft spot for the 1994 Street Fighter movie--but lately, we've seen some big changes in this genre.

The Super Mario Bros. Movie took the world by storm last year, earning an obscene amount of cash at the box office, while the Uncharted and both Sonic the Hedgehog movies were also successful. With fresh new IPs to option, dozens of video game movies have been announced over the last couple of years, and while production is moving swiftly on several of them, many more appear to be trapped in the lowest levels of development hell.

We're hopeful that we'll see some progress on these long-in-development films, but until Hollywood says otherwise, here's a deep dive into the video game movies that could be showing at your local cinema in the future. If there's not an attached release date or it's not a sequel, though, keep in mind these could also just never be made in the end.","GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.

Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and centered around a plot involving time travel, itâ€™s a sci-fi thriller thatâ€™s earned plenty of fans thanks to its over-the-top action. Now, more than 30 years after its debut, Timecop is getting a 4K Blu-ray release. The Timecop 4K Blu-ray is now up for preorder ahead of its April 29 launch.

Timecop 4K Blu-ray $40 | Releases April 29 This version of Timecop gets you both 4K UHD and standard Blu-ray copies of the film. The first disc includes a 4K transfer from the 35mm original camera negative, which should result in a faithful 4K remaster. It supports Dolby Vision and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. The second disc offers the film in Blu-ray. No bonus features have been revealed, so it's possible this will only include the movie--you will, however, get a limited edition slipcover for storage. Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Walmart

Preorders can be found at Walmart and Amazon--and both retailers offer a preorder price guarantee that makes you eligible for any discounts between the time you preorder and launch. So if the Blu-ray goes on sale before April 29, youâ€™ll be on the hook for the lowest price. Your credit card also wonâ€™t be charged until the item ships.

Looking to round out your collection with other Jean-Claude Van Damme movies? Plenty DVDs and Blu-rays are available right now thatâ€™ll make the wait for Timecop a bit easier. In fact, you can pick up the old Timecop DVD for just $14.54 (was $16.80). Thereâ€™s also a great Kickboxer 4K Steelbook for $35, which comes bundled with 4K, Blu-ray, and digital versions of the film alongside a vibrant red steelbook case.

Want to grab a bunch of Van Damme films at once? Look at the 8-Movie Collection--a DVD bundle with The Quest, Street Fighter, The Hard Corps, Maximum Risk, and more. For just $17.28 (was $26), itâ€™s a pretty great option for frugal shoppers. Just keep in mind that this is a DVD, not a Blu-ray. But if you donâ€™t mind the lower resolution, itâ€™s an excellent choice.

Jazwares says the bricks are compatible ""with all major construction brands,"" which means you should be able to expand your builds with Lego bricks and Mega Bloks.

BLDR Brick-Building Sets by Jazwares - Launch Lineup

The two anime sets looks especially good, because for $20, you're getting build-it-yourself action figures of two breakout stars in modern manga and anime. They have an impressive range of articulation and they come with character-accurate accessories to help replicate several of their iconic poses. If you like Lego's Construction Figure line, these look like the BLDR version of those.

Meanwhile, the Hello Kitty sets are just downright adorable. Based on the mega-popular Sanrio franchise, you can pick up three sets featuring Kitty White and her friends, including Keroppi Mart for $20, Dream Cafe for $30, and Badtz-Maru's Convertible for only $10. Each set includes BLDR's version of minifigures, and we think Jazwares did a great job capturing the Sanrio aesthetic.

The BLDR line also includes several sets based on Jazwares' Squishmallow plushie toys, resulting in more diorama pieces that can be easily displayed.

If you're interested in these, you may also want to keep Lego's newly announced One Piece series on your radar. These BLDR figures look like a pretty fun way to bide the time until Lego's foray into the world of anime arrives.

Whatever you call them, they're made much more reachable thanks to our Astro Bot collectibles guide, which reveals an in-game mechanic that allows you to track down hidden cameo bots with ease. It's not the only hidden in-game mechanic either, as you can unlock a secret photo mode in Astro Bot, too.

Whether you're still tracking down all of the secret characters in Astro Bot or you just want to see if your favorite character made it into the game, here's a roundup of all the secret bots we've found so far.

Because the in-game gallery of characters uses pseudonyms for each of them, we've labeled them with their proper names and mentioned which series they belong to.

Astro Bot speed running levels have begun rolling out as weekly updates, adding two new cameo bots with each level. We have added the first four to the bottom of this list and will continue adding them as the levels are released.","Like its predecessor, Astro Bot is a love letter to PlayStation--not just its current make-up, either, but its illustrious history.

33,Civilization 7: Best Legacy To Pick In Every Age,['Joey Carr'],"And finally, we arrive at the Modern Age in Civilization VII. This age will likely start with the map mostly uncovered and feature more civilization names that you recognize. You'll presumably have met all possible leaders in your playthrough, have set relationships with them, and are looking at an empire that features close to or over 10-15 settlements. Through the course of two ages, you should have a fairly large military complete with Army Commanders and units as well plenty of naval units to navigate the seas with.

All that said, the best Legacy for the Modern Age is the Military Legacy. The Modern Age is your last gasp before the end of the playthrough, so you want to make it count. Trying to take over the entire map is a realistic goal if you have the forces and defenses for it, so going with the Military Advisor's recommendations will help make that happen. There's also no real point in keeping friendly relationships with more than one or two other leaders, so you might as well invade their lands to take as many settlements as you can.

In the Modern Age, your military units are the strongest they've ever been, your towns and cities are well-fortified, and you have a flowing supply of gold, Influence, and other resources to rely on. There's nothing else to do besides trying to totally dominate the map and establish as many footholds as possible. The Military Advisor will also lead you on the path to flight, which opens up entirely new doors in combat.

Lastly, the Military Legacy offers some of the best endings possible in Civ 7. From researching the Manhattan Project to producing a Nuclear Weapon, there are plenty of fun and explosive ways to end the game if you follow the Military Legacy.

There's so much to learn and discover when you're exploring the massive world of Civ 7. Be sure to use our Civilization 7 guides hub to find all of our guides on the game in one spot.","And finally, we arrive at the Modern Age in Civilization VII.

This is done by studying the Piety civic and then building a Temple in your settlements. When you found your own religion, you may also select one Reliquary Belief and one Founder Belief.

Likewise, take note that you can train a Missionary in any settlement that has a Temple. Missionary units have ""Spread Religion"" charges. All you need to do is move them to another settlement to convert that place to your religion.

Note 1: You may also recruit Missionaries from settlements without any religion or those that another civ converted to their religion. The only important thing is that the settlement has a temple. For example, you can forward-settle a town close to another civ, buy a Temple using gold, and then buy Missionaries so they can start converting your opponent's territories.

Note 2: Converting a settlement's population depends on the tile where you used the ""Spread Religion"" action. A good example is how large cities have separate urban and rural population.

You can learn more about these details in our Ideologies guide. What's important to remember is that civs with no ideology grant +2 points for each settlement that you capture. Meanwhile, civs with an opposing ideology grant +3 points for each settlement.

Step 1: Study the Political Theory civic.

Step 2: Study any Ideology civic--i.e. Democracy, Fascism, or Communism. Research the Combustion tech.

Step 3: Research the Flight rech. Capture an ideological enemy's settlement (or those from a civ without any ideological belief).

Step 4: Score 10x points in total.

Step 5: Score 15x points in total.

To get RT points, you must have Rail Stations in your settlements, as these buildings allow you to construct Factories. Each settlement that has a Factory lets you assign 1x resource into a special slot. Each ""Factory Resource"" grants an RT point per turn.

Ah, but you're not done yet. Upon reaching 500 RT points, a Great Banker will spawn in your capital.

The Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 For Whom the Bell Tolls main quest is easily one of the most tense experiences in the entire campaign. This takes place immediately after the events of Wedding Crashers, as Henry and Hans find themselves imprisoned in Trosky Castle.

Here's the kicker: Henry is allowed to do manual labor as punishment for his crimes. Hans, unfortunately, is set to hang in the gallows for poaching animals. To rescue him from certain doom, you need to find Captain Thomas, who can vouch for your identity and mission, but he's resting in the Maiden Tower high above one corner of the fortress.

By far the most important caveat is that Hans is set to get executed once the bells have tolled twelve times. Early on, the first instance is slightly delayed. However, once you hear the first ring of the bells, each succeeding toll happens every five minutes. That means you only have one hour to ask Captain Thomas for help so you could save Hans.

Note 1: Many sections of Trosky Castle are considered restricted areas. However, when you complete tasks or talk to NPCs, these areas open up, allowing you to explore them freely without being accosted by guards.

Note 2: Henry has lost his inventory, too. This means you have to find lockpicks on your own. Worse, you don't have a single Savior Schnapps item.

52,Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - Demons Of Trosky Quest Guide,['Jason Rodriguez'],"Yes, there's supposed to be a fifth fireplace in the Maiden Tower. It's actually located in the feasting hall on the second floor (i.e. next to the widower hallway).

Here's the weird part: Both doors that lead to the feasting hall are closed, and there's no way to interact with them--i.e. not even a button prompt to use lockpicks. Funnily enough, you do get to enter the feasting hall during the For Victory quest, but this also causes Demons of Trosky to end prematurely.

Initially, we thought that this was just a bug. However, given what we've witnessed from NPCs and later events that transpired, we started to believe that the NPCs were just trolling us. Still, if you're able to open the door to the feasting hall in your playthrough, then you should be fine.

56,Civilization 7: How To Disperse An Independent Power,['Joey Carr'],"Now that you have a better idea of what Independent Powers are and how to find them, it's time to go over how to disperse them. To disperse an Independent Power, all you have to do is find one and challenge their capital tile with military forces. Directly attack the capital until its district defenses have completely fallen and every one of its troops inside the capital is gone or dead.

Once that happens, move any one of your military units onto the capital tile of the Independent. If your unit has a move left in the current turn, select them and then expand the left side of their combat menu at the bottom of the screen (press the arrow). Here, right under the option to ""rest,"" you should see an icon with a skull on it. Hover over that icon to see that it says ""Disperse Independent.""

Naturally, you want to click the icon, which completely dismantles the Independent Power and removes the settlement from the map entirely. If you dispersed an Encampment, its settlement will return in a new spot on the map in roughly two dozen turns. However, if you disperse a village, then it will be completely removed without a trace for the rest of the game.

With Machiavelli as my leader, the first time I dispersed an Independent Power completed ""The Prince"" objective. However, you might have to disperse a certain number of Independents to satisfy your specific objective, so make sure to read your journal carefully. You can access the journal by clicking the trophy icon at the top-left of the screen in Civilization VII.

There's so much else to learn and discover when you're exploring the massive world of Civ 7.

58,26 Best Sims 4 Mods To Download In 2025,"['Phil Owen', 'Anna Koselke']","GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.

Now that we're a decade into the lifespan of The Sims 4, the game's modding community is massive--if you play on PC, you have a mind-boggling amount of mod options available to you, with numerous different mod hubs to download things from and a bunch of modders who literally make The Sims mods for a living via Patreon. And with EA declaring that The Sims 4 is here to stay for the foreseeable future, it's safe to expect that the modding situation with The Sims 4 is only going to get more expansive and more complicated.

With that being the case, finding the best Sims 4 mods amid an ever-expanding, endless sea of custom content is oftentimes daunting, especially as the life-simulation game's bustling community continues to grow steadily with each new expansion pack release and update. These DLC drops and patches are hardly few and far between, either, as EA's unique blend of real life and all of its ups and downs with its whimsically silly cartoonish aesthetic proves to be successful time and time again with each expansion launch. With various such expansions, kits, and stuff packs constantly underway for the fourth and most widely played entry in the iconic Sims series, it's no wonder that its creative fanbase is also getting bigger and better over time.

With more fans, the community also gets more creators. With more creators, it gets more Sims 4 gameplay mods. While frequent DLC releases are exciting, not everyone can afford to purchase each expansion upon its launch date and many drops leave players wishing for more than EA has to offer. This is where all of the free Sims 4 mods come in, bringing all of the content Simmers have been requesting and then some. While most everyone knows how to download these desirable Sims 4 mods, whether that be via handy online libraries such as Mod The Sims or personal creators' Patreon collections, the often grueling task of searching through countless pages can feel downright overwhelming.

60,Best Tower Defense Games To Strategize Your Way Through In 2025,['Joey Carr'],"Developer : Hidden Path Entertainment

: Hidden Path Entertainment Release Date: December 8, 2008

December 8, 2008 Platforms: Xbox 360, PC

Defense Grid: The Awakening might be one of the older entries on this list, but it's still one of the stronger games to come out of the tower defense genre in the last 20 years. There's a main storyline you can play through that will last you up to eight hours, but as with most games in the genre, there's much more replayability beyond that.

When you start Defense Grid: The Awakening, you'll begin on some fairly easy levels that challenge your basic ability to set defenses. As you progress, you'll unlock new tower upgrades and types, with each tower having three distinct capability levels. The different towers all have strengths and weaknesses and some might be strong on one map while weak on another. Speaking of maps, there are 20 unique ones in Defense Grid: The Awakening, with more available through a paid map pack. The maps can spawn a total of 15 different enemies that become stronger the more you play.

The enemy variation and the amount of them that come into play often make every round feel like itâ€™s coming down right to the wire. While your towers might not get overwhelmed at the start of a round, stronger enemies in larger numbers show up as the round goes on and can overthrow your entire strategy.

While Defense Grid: The Awakening is an older game, it still captures the magic of what a tower defense game is supposed to be. Pair that with graphics that look straight out of Halo and you have a game well worth checking out.","When you start Defense Grid: The Awakening, you'll begin on some fairly easy levels that challenge your basic ability to set defenses.

As one of the last major releases of 2024, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle missed out on some of the year-end awards. However, it was the lone new release to break into the 20 best-selling games in the United States for December, according to market research firm Circana--as provided by executive director Mat Piscatella on Bluesky.

Bethesda's Indiana Jones game came in at No. 14 for December, but there was never any suspense about which game would hit No. 1. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 not only retained its crown, it also became the best-selling game of 2024 in the US. That extends the franchise's record for the best-selling video game franchise in the US to 16 years in a row.

As they did last month, EA sports titles' Madden NFL 25, EA Sports College Football 25, and EA Sports FC 25 took up the next three slots. Surprisingly, EA's Dragon Age: The Veilguard didn't make the top 20, which coincides with word that the game fell well below the company's sales expectations. Nintendo's Super Mario Party Jamboree came in at No. 5.

Some of the slightly older titles to reenter the list in December were God of War: Ragnarok, Mario Kart 8, and Elden Ring. Many of the other games were consistent with November's domestic sales, although the order of each title slightly differed last month. Total video game sales were down 9% in 2024. That includes a 29% drop in console sales, while content sales fell only 5% by themselves.

The complete list of titles is below, but it may not necessarily reflect the full picture of each game's domestic sales.

Indie games are a widely celebrated part of the video game industry, and they've only been getting better and better as time goes on. What defines an indie game is somewhat up for debate, and in some cases it can be difficult to tell indies from bigger titles.

One person's definition of an indie may not match another's, but generally, an indie game is developed by one person or a small team without a larger publisher's budget behind it. Sometimes, the developer behind an indie game will grow into a larger studio and develop future games that are considered outside the realm of the indie label. Indies don't have to be a certain type of game or feature any kind of particular graphics or gameplay. The driving force behind what makes an indie game is the person or people behind the scenes developing it, as well as the funding behind them. That can make it a challenge to decide what is or isn't an indie, but we've done our best to account for these considerations.

With that out of the way, it's time to get into our list of the best indie games to play in 2025.

There were only three new releases on this month's list, with Nintendo's Mario & Luigi: Brothership debuting at No. 7, while the remake of Dragon Quest 3 came in 12th place, and EA's My Sims: Cozy Bundle debuted at 19.

Although Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics was not a new release in November, it broke into the top 20 with its fan-favorite fighting games, many of which haven't been on consoles for decades. That's hopefully a good sign for more of these classic collections from Capcom.

68,The Best Pets And Animal Companions In Video Games: 2024 Edition,['Jason Rodriguez'],"Truth be told, Black Myth: Wukong has so many anthropomorphic characters--you even play as a humanoid monkey warrior--that the whole cast could be included as part of this entry. Still, it's Zhu Bajie, also known as Pigsy, who plays the most pivotal supporting role.

Zhu Bajie is one of the major characters in Journey to the West. Like Sun Wukong and Sha Wujing, he's counted among the companions of Tang Sangzang in his quest to seek the ancient Buddhist scriptures. Due to his lustful and gluttonous nature, Zhu Bajie is eventually cursed to live as a humanoid pig, earning the moniker Pigsy.

In Black Myth: Wukong, which serves as a continuation of the tale, Pigsy aids the Destined One in his attempt to gather Sun Wukong's relics. Similar to his depiction in the novel, Pigsy remains gruff, boisterous, and rude. However, he also shows remorse for his actions in the past, especially with how he treated his former lover, the Violet Spider, as well as their daughter. Cursed to suffer a thousand romantic tragedies, Zhu Bajie has no choice but to accept a lifetime of wandering, whether or not his feelings for someone are genuine. And, yes, he also serves as a neat distraction for enemies whenever he's with you. Just watch out because you also battle him a couple of times, and these encounters truly test your mettle.","Truth be told, Black Myth: Wukong has so many anthropomorphic characters--you even play as a humanoid monkey warrior--that the whole cast could be included as part of this entry.

69,The Best Secrets In Video Games: 2024 Edition,['Jason Rodriguez'],"Let's get this out of the way: You need to be ready for a lot of frustrations if you play Dragon's Dogma 2 while unprepared. The game not only has colossal boss creatures that can attack you while you're traveling, but also missable class unlocks and character romances. Perhaps more notoriously, there's a devastating curse known as the Dragonsplague that can wipe out entire towns.

But your adventure will be enriched if you're patient enough to explore these lands. Your treks might even lead you to the Sphinx, who presents you with 10 riddles with equally amazing rewards.

Well past that point, you can also get the game's true ending. To be clear, you're only given two options by default at the campaign's conclusion: You can either walk away from your dragon-boss opponent or defeat them in battle. But there's also a third option, which requires you to obtain the Empowered Godsbane Blade.

The Empowered Godsbane Blade can be used to stab the dragon while it's flying, causing a chain of events. Soon, you'll find yourself in the Unmoored World, where the entire realm is facing graver threats in the form of deadlier monsters and bosses. You can either prevent wanton destruction by eliminating challenging bosses or look for a way to help citizens evacuate.","Perhaps more notoriously, there's a devastating curse known as the Dragonsplague that can wipe out entire towns.

70,The Best Xbox Games Of 2024 According To Metacritic,"['Chris Pereira', 'Steve Watts', 'Gabe Gurwin', 'Darryn Bonthuys', 'Mark Delaney']","GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.

We're four years into the current Xbox Series X|S generation, and in 2024, it was business mostly as usual for Microsoft's console brand. While the biggest news this year related to Xbox was a new focus on bringing several of its first-party games to PS5 and Nintendo Switch, Xbox also saw an evolution of its Game Pass subscription service and an option for users of the Ultimate tier to stream select games they own. On top of a marketing push designed to remind people that they technically don't need the console to play Xbox games, 2024 shaped up to be a year of diversification for Microsoft's gaming ecosystem.

What of the games then? This was a pretty strong year overall, as the Xbox library was bolstered with first-party games like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl. Third-party games like Neon White and Final Fantasy 14 only added to the appeal of sitting down for a night of gaming on an Xbox console, and with Game Pass having numerous day-one releases, you'd find yourself spoiled for choice on what you could download and play, especially when one of those options was Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.

GameSpot sister Metacritic has crunched the numbers on the best-reviewed Xbox games of the year--as of December 5--and if you're interested, you can check them all out in the list below.

PC has continued to see more games releases from Sony and Microsoft, which, combined with all of the exclusives the platform gets, makes it a great place to play.

The best role-playing games are the ones that effortlessly transport you to faraway lands, and in 2024, there was no shortage of fantasy adventures in this genre.

73,The Best Boss Fights Of 2024,['Claire Lewis'],"In the original 2001 game, this boss fight was fairly underwhelming, but Bloober Team's 2024 remake of Silent Hill 2 reworks a once-uninteresting boss fight into something truly special. The original fight was essentially two people standing in a room and clumsily shooting at each other, but the 2024 remake changes the setting to a foggy walk-in freezer with sacks of raw meat hanging from the ceiling. The meat sacks provide some amount of cover, but also prove to be an obstacle, especially with the fog obscuring the player's view of Eddie. The room is dimly lit, with the flash of Eddie's gunfire serving as the only visual indicator of his position for a large portion of the fight. He's not pulling his punches, either--Eddie can very easily kill the player in just two shots on Hard Mode.

While the improved level design and combat mechanics play a huge part in making the fight a terrifying one, this deadly game of cat-and-mouse is made all the more unnerving by the differences in Eddie's characterization. The original game painted him as an insecure jerk and not much more, but the remake gives players deeper insight into Eddie, his motivations, and who he is as a person. Watching his mental state slowly unravel over the course of the game makes every cutscene he's in feel extremely tense, like there's an invisible thread in Eddie that's one wrong look away from snapping. Ultimately, it does snap, and both the game's protagonist and the player themselves are forced to grapple with what it means to take a life. While Eddie certainly isn't any more likable than he used to be, Bloober Team's take on the character does make him more believable and three-dimensional. When he finally falls to the floor at James' feet, his baseball cap falls off, revealing a head of blond hair that looks quite similar to James' own. The message is clear: Yes, he's a jerk. But he's not any more or less of a person than James is, and although he forces the player into combat, it's hard to finish the fight without wondering if there could have been another way.

The obvious effort Bloober Team put into improving the Eddie fight is deserving of praise in itself. Turning a formerly snooze-worthy opponent into one that arguably surpasses the likes of Pyramid Head is no small task, and the heart-pounding tension of this battle combined with its surprisingly emotional conclusion is what makes it our favorite boss fight of 2024.

2024 was a year of surprise hits and critical flops for Sony and its PlayStation division, as games like Helldivers 2 and Astro Bot launched to critical acclaim while other projects like Concord were released to middling reviews and general player apathy.

While this year was also light on first-party exclusives, third-party studios came to the rescue with a selection of games covering multiple genres. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Stellar Blade were two notable examples of PS5-only games releasing this year--they're both headed to PC in 2025--while other studios released must-play titles like Metaphor: ReFantazio (our Game of the Year), Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, and Silent Hill 2 on the Sony system.

Heck, even Microsoft wanted to attract a few PlayStation gamers to its brand, leading to former Xbox Series X|S exclusives like Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Grounded, and Sea of Thieves releasing on its gaming rival's hardware, which expanded this year with the release of the PS5 Pro console.

Odds are, you know the big games in a given year. If you regularly play games, it's hard not to at least hear the names of the latest releases from big publishers, which spend huge sums of money to spread awareness of these releases. But it's often in the smaller, less widely known games that you see the most creativity, innovation, and originality. These are often games that are not seeking to appeal to as many people as possible and are instead the vision of a smaller number of people. That can mean that, when you find the right one, it feels like it's meant for you, because it's so acutely designed to appeal to your particular tastes and sensibilities.

As such, identifying hidden gems can be a real treat, because it's an opportunity for us to help spread the word on games we love that might have flown under the radar for you. Just look at Steam or any other digital games storefront and it's hard not to be struck by the staggering number of games that release each week, let alone each year. It's no surprise that there are so many great games that any given person has never heard of.

Some games that fit that description can also be found in our personal favorites list, where we compiled our individual top choices that didn't make the site's overall top 10.

Who doesn't want to be Batman? Fast cars, a utility belt full of gadgets, and a brain loaded with punch-based dental techniques for discouraging criminals makes for the ultimate--and believable!--superhero, provided that you have the cash and willpower to adopt that lifestyle. For most of us, the closest that we'll get to being Batman is to boot up one of the many video games that have been released over the years: vigilante simulators that have attempted to merge the many elements of Batman together into a cohesive package of brains, brawn, and Batmobiles.

Not every game has succeeded, and there have have been more than a few misfires over the decades. Batman: Dark Tomorrow is an infamous digital disaster that did more damage to the icon than Bane's Venom-powered chiropractic arts, there's at least one Batman Forever movie tie-in game that plays like a clumsy Mortal Kombat clone, and the official Batman & Robin game on PS1 makes the film it's based on look like Citizen Bob Kane in comparison.

Part of the draw with the Quest is the cord-free, standalone experience--everything you need to start playing is in the box. That said, the Quest 3S can be connected to your PC wirelessly via Air/Steam Link to play Steam VR games. Meta also has a 16-foot USB-C Link Cable, if you have issues with performance or latency. But keep in mind your gaming PC needs to be capable of playing the games you want to stream on your headset.

So while it's true the Meta Quest 3S and its more powerful older sibling, the Quest 3, are technically standalone VR platforms that don't require a computer, PC gamers can expand the catalog of games available to them with ease.

The Quest 3S comes with two Touch Pro controllers and comes in two storage configurations: 128GB for $300 and 256GB for $400. It's priced the same as the now discontinued Quest 2 while offering considerably better performance. It's equipped with the same chipset and RAM as the $500 Quest 3, Meta's flagship VR headset. The Quest 3 offers better resolution via its 2064 x 2208 pancake lenses. To cut costs, the 3S is fitted with the 1832 x 1920 fresnel lenses found in the Quest 2.

As an added bonus, all Quest 3 and 3S headsets come with the newly released exclusive Batman: Arkham Shadow for a limited time. You'll also get three months of Quest+, a subscription program featuring a rotating library of games for subscribers as well as two freebies to keep, even if you cancel your subscription.

The Quest 3S is an impressive piece of hardware that offers the best introduction to VR for newcomers.

82,The Best Steam Deck Accessories In 2024,['Brendan Hesse'],"The benefits of a microSD card is obvious: they let you install more games to your Steam Deck. Thatâ€™s not to say the Steam Deck is lacking in storage spaceâ€“especially if youâ€™re sticking to older games and indie titles with smaller installation footprintsâ€“but considering the size of many AAA PC games these days, itâ€™s worth investing in a microSD card.

MicroSD memory cards come in a range of sizes and storage speeds. Performance differences are negligible between microSD cards, and speed of the microSD card isn't really of concern for actual gameplay. However, if you transfer lots of games, it will make a difference. As for size, we wouldn't recommend buying anything under 256GB. Sure, smaller sizes can still be helpful, but if youâ€™re shelling out for a high-end card anyway, itâ€™s better to spring for a larger size once rather than upgrading again down the line.

But regardless of which size or speed you ultimately go for, itâ€™s important to stick with major brands. Not only are cards from companies like Samsung or SanDisk more reliable and last longer, but theyâ€™re also safer, as many cheaper or knockoff microSDs are outright fakes.

If need suggestions on which to buy, our overall top pick is the Samsung Pro Plus 512GB microSD. Itâ€™s also available in a 256GB version.

If you need a 1TB memory card, we recommend the SanDisk 1TB Ultra microSDXC. If you can afford it, thereâ€™s also a 1.5TB model, which is the largest storage size currently available. The smaller 256 and 512GB models are also great options, offering some of the best value of all the microSD cards available.

MicroSD cards offer the best value and will be the right choice for most players, but if you bought the 64GB model or even one of the 256GB versions, you may want to upgrade your internal storage. If you have the 64GB model, your M.2 2230 NVMe SSD slot is empty already, while Steam Decks with internal SSDs already installed will require you to clone the original SSD when upgrading. We've included several NVMe SSD options below the microSD cards--though we'd still recommend pairing your new SSD with a microSD card.","The benefits of a microSD card is obvious: they let you install more games to your Steam Deck.
Performance differences are negligible between microSD cards, and speed of the microSD card isn't really of concern for actual gameplay.

88,"Yes, Metroid Prime 4 Is Still Coming Out In 2025",['Darryn Bonthuys'],"Metroid Prime fans are a patient lot, and after almost a decade of waiting, 2025 looks like it'll be their year. Nintendo confirmed that this year will be a big one, as not only will the Switch 2 console launch, but the long-in-development Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be one of several tentpole games released in 2025 as well.

While it doesn't have an exact date yet. Nintendo did confirm in the financial results for the first nine months of its latest fiscal year that Metroid Prime 4 is one of the big four first-party 2025 releases, alongside the recently released Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, Xenoblade Chronicles X on March 20, and Pokemon Legends Z-A.

Metroid Prime 4 is out this year.

Metroid Prime 4 was announced for Switch all the way back at E3 2017, but beyond that, there was nothing but radio silence surrounding the game. In 2019, Nintendo announced that it had rebooted development on the game as it had not reached the standards the publisher wanted from it. This means the game will likely be backward-compatible with the Switch 2, although it's unclear if there'll be a native Switch 2 version available for purchase.

After several more years of silence--with the void being temporarily filled with Metroid Dread and Metroid Prime Remastered--the game re-emerged in Summer 2024 with a brand-new teaser trailer. There's still a lot that we don't know about Metroid Prime 4, but as we get closer to its eventual release, it's highly likely that Nintendo will start to drop a few trailers detailing what fans can expect when they step back into Samus Aran's power-armor.

In related news, Nintendo just broke a 13-year record with its Switch console sales figures and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe continues to be a major commercial hit for the company. It hasn't been all good news for Nintendo, as the company did confirm that Switch hardware and software sales were ""below expectations"" and this has led to the company lowering its sales predictions. Nintendo expects Switch console sales to reach 11 million--down from its previous forecast of 12.5 million sales--for its current fiscal year ending on March 31, 2025.","Metroid Prime fans are a patient lot, and after almost a decade of waiting, 2025 looks like it'll be their year.

89,"Star Wars Brings The Dark Side To Destiny 2 With Lightsaber Emotes, Death Star Ghost, And More",['Lan Pitts'],"GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.

Star Wars and Destiny 2 have come together in a brand-new colllaboration that features new in-game armor, Ghost shell, emotes, Sparrow, and ship, all with that shiny Star Wars branding. The collaboration was announced last week with a tease of things to come only showing the Imperial armor ornament sets.

The armor sets are one per class, with Shock Enforcers (Stormtroopers) for Titans, Covert Rangers (Death Troopers) for Hunters, and Royal Protector (Imperial Guard) for Warlocks.

This is the latest collaboration with Destiny as past collaborations included The Witcher, Mass Effect, and Assassin's Creed, but Star Wars is easily the most prominent and well-known. The new items were released as part of update 8.2.0, which kicked off Episode Heresy.

The Death Star Ghost shell that lights up with its beam might be a new personal favorite. There's a lot of range with the offerings from the Unlimited Power Finisher from the prequel trilogy, to the Riot Control from the sequel trilogy, referencing a scene in The Force Awakens. There's also the Death Troopers from Rogue One and the Mandalorian.

All of these items are available individually for Silver (purchased with real-world money), with some coming in bundles that discount the price. There doesn't appear to be any means of acquiring the items with Bright Dust, which can be earned by playing. Check out all of the available items below.","Star Wars and Destiny 2 have come together in a brand-new colllaboration that features new in-game armor, Ghost shell, emotes, Sparrow, and ship, all with that shiny Star Wars branding.
